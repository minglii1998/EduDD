    "title": "Blogging: Confessing to the world",
    "text": "Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your whereabouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, ‘Hey, I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous – and we are lost. \nDepressing? Perhaps, but don’t give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity’s temptations and perils – all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it’s worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. \nIn January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the ‘WWW’, as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at Cern, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once.\nHall’s ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall’s site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he’d fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told ‘either the blog goes, or I do’. He’d published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, ‘it makes people not trust me’. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to ‘make people want to be with you’, you’ll be disappointed. \nIn 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong’s blog to every vice president at her company – including some whom she’d mocked – and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the ‘online distribution effect’: that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we’d never dream of saying in person. But the web isn’t some king of alternative reality where we can let our hair down without worrying about repercussions. Our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes.\nArmstrong’s saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of ‘mommy bloggers’ and her writing supports her household. Once a poster-child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should.",

    "text": "A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience? I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets.\nA mate of mine happened to be getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. \nI’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock.\nI got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend,  I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.",

    "text": "When my first cookery programme In Search of Perfection first came out, I had no idea how it would be received by the viewers and the press. There had been plenty of talk going round at the time about the food ‘revolution’ sweeping through Britain, and I was certain that we’d produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that, but still the question worried me: would people appreciate an approach to cooking that involved not just techniques but also history, nostalgia and science? I watched the first programme in a mixed state of joy and fear.\nI needn’t have worried. The subsequent success of the show paved the way for all sorts of other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project there is a sense of being on a journey, be it into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these, however, the journey was often a very physical one, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, and in it you’ll zigzag the globe in order to meet some extraordinary artisans, such as a man who finds his true purpose in creating a golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent decades pursuing their own ideals of perfection.\nPerfection is, of course, highly subjective. Even the seemingly simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a nightmare, and I knew I was bound to upset many people by leaving out their particular favourite. ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ I could imagine people saying. Nevertheless, after shutting ourselves away in a meeting room and agreeing not to emerge until we had come up with a suitable list, the TV production team and I eventually had something for everyone.\nThis reinforced my opinion that each of us has our own idea of what constitutes perfection, drawing heavily on a highly personalised mix of emotions, memories and surroundings. Despite the book’s title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn’t be claiming the recipes were in any way ‘definitive’. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, by talking to food producers and artisans and chefs and their customers, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.\nWhile the dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as the state of being perfect, it also offers a second definition of equal importance to this book: honing through continual experimentation. Trying out ideas and then revising them until you’ve got something unique. The TV series gave me the opportunity to get out and look into all sorts of foods, people and places I’d never encountered before in any restaurant, and I was as excited about that as I was about the chance to explore memory and nostalgia in food because I started out in this business in exactly the same way.\nSearching out the best ingredients for the recipes took me all over the globe. Among my adventures were: being taken with great solemnity and assurance to a canning factory that turned out to be processing completely the wrong sort of tomato, and visiting a dairy farm whose standards fell so far short of perfection that we had to stop filming there! Refining the technique for each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and then using dry ice to turn it into ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine and nearly burning my house down in an effort to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza.",

    "title": "American Black Ducks\nby Sam Prentice, wildlife biologist",
    "text": "I work at a US university where my team and I are trying to learn more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. And we’ve just started using an exciting piece of equipment called a ‘night-vision scope’, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark! \nWe’re worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. There’s lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn.\nIt is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We’ve studied ducks in different locations, and I’ve had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. \nStill I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!",

    "title": "Rollercoasters\nJournalist Kashmira Gander found out about how rollercoasters are designed.",
    "text": "Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Palms clammy with fear, nails digging into the harness, you come to a grinding halt and inhale sharply before the carriage creeps slowly upwards. A pause. Then a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. Teeth gritted, you hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, then upside down. Your senses a blur, you let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut. But you only have yourself to blame: after all, like hundreds of millions of others each year, you were happy to pay the price of getting into a theme park.\nWhat’s somewhat mystifying to me is that amusement parks, with their hair-raising rides aimed at pulling in crowds, are a huge industry. To deliver the thrills and ultimate-escape-from-reality that guests seek, behind the scenes there are huge teams of highly inventive – and arguably a little cruel – structural, mechanical, industrial and electrical engineers, as well as designers and marketing experts.\n‘Rollercoaster designer’ sounds like the career aspiration of a primary school child when asked what they want to be when they grow up. In reality, it’s a big challenge: not just creating the perfect balance of pleasure and fear while ensuring that passengers are not in any danger; but also introducing enough novelty to keep visitors wanting more.\nFor, while the layperson may imagine that rollercoasters have become ever more intense, in fact most of the techniques used today – including the wheel that allows rides to go upside-down – were invented by the US designer John Miller in the early 20th century. In his pre-regulation ‘golden age’, the extremities of rollercoasting were explored – to the discomfort of many passengers – but now creators are limited to the track designs offered by specialist ride manufacturers.\nI spoke to three experts on rollercoasters. ‘The skill,’ said Professor Brendan Walker, a ‘thrill engineer’ with a background in aeronautics, ‘is in compiling the pieces.’ And what that means, said Dr John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, is ‘swapping very rapidly between plus and minus, so people get the sense of being sort of thrown around but kept safe. It’s a very fine line between people feeling the ride is thrilling and that feeling they’ve been bumped around.’\nIn the search for a superlative ride, the teams behind rollercoasters must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle, that works with any innovations – the tallest ride, the most twists, the steepest drops – to create a seamless experience. However, said Professor Walker, in the end, as in many creative industries, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work. ‘It helps to be a bit of a thrill-nut if you are designing rollercoasters, in order to understand exactly what passengers are looking for, and to test your rides before they are opened to the public,’ agreed Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development.\nSurely, though, I asked them, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality? Walker said we shouldn’t hold our breath. ‘Virtual reality can add a veneer, but only in the way that an old fashioned rollercoaster was fantastically painted,’ he said. ’New technology comes along all the time, and the parks are very quick to embrace it because it is exciting and can add to ride experience. But underpinning that is the physical coaster experience, and I think that will remain king for many years to come.’",

    "title": "A career in music\nReporter Eamonn Forde met UK songwriter and music producer Jamie Scott.",
    "text": "Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits of recent years. His is a story of why endurance and persistence are essential in the music business – even if, initially, your career seems only to consist of false starts. He says his mother was ‘an amazing singer’ who also got him started on the guitar. The only radio he heard in his house was a local radio station for middle-aged people, which goes some way to explaining what influenced him as he was growing up. He says he was 12 before he heard a contemporary song. At about the same time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at national level, and music – he was spending his lunchtimes in the music room at school working out songs on the piano. ‘With the tennis playing, I was at quite a high level,’ he says. ‘But it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was just too much hard work.’\nAt 17, he left school to try to make it as a performer. He was part of a duo with a friend who, while not sharing his enthusiasm for making a career out of performing, was a reasonably accomplished guitarist. ‘I went to my parents and I just broke down,’ he recalls. ‘I told them this is what I wanted to do, that I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons and I had been playing the piano every day when everyone else was out playing.’ His dad gave him a deadline of 18 months to make it; if he didn’t, he would have to get a job. After a few near misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher when he was 19, off the back of one song. However, record labels were only interested in him as a solo act and so he had to split with his friend.\nIn the end, it was behind the scenes rather than on stage where he would make his name. After a difficult period signed to a record label in the UK, he asked them to let him go and he switched to another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not follow. ‘It feels like to me in my own artist career that, I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of that time,’ he says. ‘But as a writer I’ve been in the right place at the right time.’\nWriting for others is where he was to really find his feet. ‘I’d like to think that I am one of the main writers in the UK that UK labels look to send up-and-coming artists to’ he says. This, he believes, helps launch their careers.\nSometimes he has to explain to the artists he's helping that writing with an eye on the charts is nothing to be ashamed of. ‘Why? Why don’t you want to? Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month? I’m not saying that they should write a bad song, but we should get to something that they think is amazing and that I think is amazing and something that’s likely to sell well too.’\nIt is refreshing in an age of false modesty in the world of pop music to hear someone speak so bluntly about wanting to write huge songs that go to number one. There is no sense of arrogance or entitlement with Scott; he just realised long ago that he wants to write number ones and that he has a natural ability to do it. So, rather than tie himself in knots trying to make himself sound acceptable to other people, he just gets on with it.\n‘That’s the endgame for when I go into the studio with someone,’ he says. ‘Whatever happens, we need to state that this is on the global level and that we need to write the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’",

    "text": "Lucy was talking at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom to two of the other pianists playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival but, unlike her, not competing: a guy from Tokyo and a girl from a European city Lucy didn’t quite catch over the noise, whose name was Liesel or Louisa or something. They were both older than she was by about ten years, both good enough English speakers to talk about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next. \n‘I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,’ Lucy told them. \nIt sounded impressive. Not that she wanted to go to the Tanglewood festival. As she hadn’t wanted to do so many of the things that filled her time: the concerts and competitions that took her around the world and caused her to miss such massive chunks of school that she wasn’t officially enrolled any more. Instead she worked with various tutors from the University of San Francisco.\nShe hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only took fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she’d made it. There’d been a party. Lucy’s dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn’t even applied. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. \n‘I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,’ her mom had said. \nRight, Lucy had thought. More like you didn't want to give me the chance to say no. \nThat was when Lucy still believed that rocking the boat was the worst thing a person could do, and it didn't even cross her mind to try to get out of it.\nThe guy from Tokyo leaned forwards as if he had misheard her.\n‘Tanglewood?’\n‘Yeah.’ \n‘How old are you? \n‘Fifteen.’ \nHe exchanged a glance with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ \nLucy hadn’t meant to brag. It could be hard to find the line between sharing credentials in an effort to fit in and showing off. \n‘It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try...’ \n‘Excuse me,’ Liesel/Louisa said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she had to go talk to. Tokyo stayed. \n‘Have you ever been to Japan?’ He had long, shaggy hair, like a lot of the guy musicians had, to show the world they may be music nerds but they were rebel music nerds. ‘Once. When I was, like, eight.’ \nHe started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared at her elbow. \n‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.’ He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. ‘And don't get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition.’\n‘Everyone is the competition.’ \nHer grandfather ferried her around the room and made her talk to everyone he thought important. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, hearing about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after they'd left the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’ \nShe did like that part. Being somebody. Even if it meant certain people were jealous or thought she was too young to get the kind of attention she did. Being a concert pianist didn't win her any special respect from the kids she’d been at school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know and wouldn't care that she could nail a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered.",

    "title": "THE FUTURE OF NEWSPAPERS",
    "text": "Anybody who says they can reliably forecast the future of newspapers is either a liar or a fool. Look at the raw figures, and newspapers seem doomed. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has fallen by between a third and half. The authoritative Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26 per cent of US citizens as against 45 per cent in 2001. There is no shortage of prophets who confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will be safely buried within 15 years at most.\nYet one of the few reliable facts of history is that old media have a habit of surviving. An over-exuberant New York journalist announced in 1835 that books and theatre ‘have had their day’ and the daily newspaper would become ‘the greatest organ of social life’. Theatre duly withstood not only the newspaper, but also cinema and then television. Radio has flourished in the TV age; cinema, in turn, has held its own against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales up 745 per cent since 2008.\nNewspapers themselves were once new media, although it took several centuries before they became the dominant medium for news. This was not solely because producing up-to-date news for a large readership over a wide area became practicable and economic only in the mid-19th century, with the steam press, the railway and the telegraph. Equally important was the emergence of the idea that everything around us is in constant movement and we need to be updated on its condition at regular intervals – a concept quite alien in medieval times and probably also to most people in the early modern era. Now, we expect change. To our medieval ancestors, however, the only realities were the passing of the seasons, punctuated by catastrophes such as famine, flood or disease that they had no reliable means of anticipating. Life, as the writer Alain de Botton puts it, was ‘ineluctably cyclical’ and ‘the most important truths were recurring’.\nJournalism as a full-time trade from which you could hope to make a living hardly existed before the 19th century. Even then, there was no obvious reason why most people needed news on a regular basis, whether daily or weekly. In some respects, regularity of newspaper publication and rigidity of format was, and remains, a burden.  Online news readers can dip in and out according to how they perceive the urgency of events. Increasingly sophisticated search engines and algorithms allow us to personalise the news to our own priorities and interests. When important stories break, internet news providers can post minute-by-minute updates. Error, misconception and foolish speculation can be corrected or modified almost instantly. There are no space restrictions to prevent narrative or analysis, and documents or events cited in news stories can often be accessed in full. All this is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication. Yet few if any providers seem alive to the new medium’s capacity for spreading understanding and enlightenment.\nInstead, the anxiety is always to be first with the news, to maximise reader comments, to create heat, sound and fury and thus add to the sense of confusion. In the medieval world, what news there was was usually exchanged amid the babble of the marketplace or the tavern, where truth competed with rumour, mishearing and misunderstanding. In some respects, it is to that world that we seem to be returning. Newspapers have never been very good – or not as good as they ought to be – at telling us how the world works. Perhaps they now face extinction. Or perhaps, as the internet merely adds to what de Botton describes as our sense that we live in ‘an unimprovable and fundamentally chaotic universe’, they will discover that they and they alone can guide us to wisdom and understanding.",

    "title": "DESPERATELY SEEKING SUCCESS\nOliver Burkeman suggests that the path to contentment is to learn to be a loser.",
    "text": "In a storehouse in an unremarkable business park in Michigan, USA, lies consumer capitalism’s graveyard – the shadow side to the upbeat, success-focused culture of modern marketing.  It’s almost certainly the only place you’ll find A Touch of Yogurt shampoo alongside the equally unpopular Breakfast Cola.  The collection – now owned by a company called GfK – is informally known as the Museum of Failed Products.  Its exhibits are products withdrawn from sale because almost nobody wanted to buy them.  The museum’s proprietor, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story on the part of designers, marketers and salespeople.  By far the most striking thing about the museum, though, is that it should exist as a viable, profit-making business at all.  You might have assumed that any manufacturer worthy of the name would have its own such collection.  Yet the executives who arrive every week are evidence of how rarely this happens.  They were apparently so averse to dwelling on the business of failure that they had neglected to keep samples of their own disasters.\nThe museum was itself a kind of accident, albeit a happier one.  Its originator, ex-marketing man Robert McMath, merely intended to accumulate a ‘reference library’ of consumer products, not failures per se.  And so, starting in the 1960s, he began purchasing a sample of every new item he could find.  What McMath hadn’t taken into account was the three-word truth that was to prove the making of his career: ‘Most products fail.’  Simply by collecting new products indiscriminately, McMath had ensured that his hoard would come to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful ones.\nIt isn’t hard to imagine how today’s culture of optimism might be responsible for the goods lining the museum’s shelves.  Each one must have made it through a series of meetings where nobody realised the product was doomed.  Even if they did, there’s a perverse incentive for marketers to plough more money into a loser: thereby forcing some sales and preserving their dignity. Little energy will have been invested in discovering what went wrong with the products; everyone involved will have conspired, perhaps unwittingly, never to speak of it again.\nThis obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the burgeoning ‘self-help’ field.  A favoured approach here ‘positive visualisation’: if you mentally picture things turning out well, they’re far more likely to do so – or so the reasoning goes. Indeed, a predisposition to look on the bright side may be so intertwined with our survival that evolution has skewed us that way.  In fact, neuroscientist Tali Sharot has compiled growing evidence that a well-functioning mind may be built to perceive the odds of things going well as greater than they really are.  Well-balanced people, her research suggests, generally have a less accurate and overly optimistic grasp of their true ability to influence events than do those who are suffering from depression.\nBut just how effective are ‘positive fantasies about the future’?  That is the question which psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her colleagues have sought to answer over recent years.  Their results are striking: spending time and energy thinking about how well things could go, it has emerged, actually depletes most people’s motivation to achieve their goals.  Groups of experimental subjects who were encouraged to think about how they were going to have a particularly high-achieving week at work, for example, ended up achieving less.\nPsychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about the nature of ability.  According to Dweck, people with a ‘fixed theory’ mind-set assume ability is innate; those with an ‘incremental theory’ believe it evolves through challenge and hard work.  Fixed-theory people find failure especially horrifying: a sign that they tried to show their ability, but didn’t measure up.  The classic example is the sports star encouraged to think of himself as a ‘natural’ – but who then fails to put in sufficient practice to realise his potential.  Incremental-theory people, meanwhile, view failure as evidence that they are stretching themselves to their current limits.  Dweck draws an analogy here with weight-training: muscles grow by being pushed to the limits of their current capacity, where fibres tear and reheal, ending up stronger than before, but the deeper point is that possessing an incremental outlook is a happier way to  be, whether or not it leads to success.

    "title": "Unlimited time off work\nBarnaby Spence considers a new idea from the world of big business\n",
    "text": "The founder of a multinational corporation recently announced that his company would no longer be keeping track of its employees’ paid holiday time. The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy. According to the founder of the multinational corporation, the idea came to him via a cheery email (reproduced in many newspapers) from his daughter. In it she sounds suspiciously like a copywriter from her father’s media team. Setting aside the fact that the means by which the announcement was made seems like a hollow attempt at ‘humanising’ what may turn out to be a less than generous policy decision, let us ask: is the idea practical?\nThe internet company and the multinational corporation are fundamentally distinct – the former has 2,000 employees and provides a single service, while the latter has 50,000 employees with dozens of subsidiary companies providing services as diverse as financial services, transport, and healthcare. The approach of ‘take as much time off as you want as long as you’re sure it won’t damage the business’ seems better suited to a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules, and so may be more comfortable in assessing whether their absence would harm the business – in any case a problematically abstract notion.\nThe founder of the multinational has stated that his employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they ‘feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business –  or, for that matter, their careers.’ Is it possible to be that sure? No matter how many loose ends you manage to tie up in advance of a holiday, there is always a mountain of work to come back to. That is simply the nature of leave; you put your work on hold, but its accumulation is inevitable and beyond your control. Someone who follows these guidelines would likely not go at all, or, at the very least, would feel overly guilty about going. Increased levels of guilt lead to stress and this, together with workers not taking sufficient leave, would lead to a decrease in productivity in the long run.\nThe situation could be compounded by pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Such pressure already affects decisions such as when to start and end the working day. Particularly in the corporate sector, there is a culture of working late, and it is easy to see how this could translate into a ‘no holiday’ culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotion. Similarly, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Essentially, they would no longer have their legal entitlement to fall back on. Perhaps then, the policy would result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave, or, they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete.\nModern technology, which allows us to receive work messages whenever and wherever we are, has blurred the distinction between work and leisure time. The internet company apparently began their unlimited leave policy when their employees asked how this new way of working could be reconciled with the company’s old-fashioned time-off policy. That is to say, if their employer was no longer able to accurately track employees’ total time on the job, why should it apply a different and outmoded standard to their time away from it? However, a potentially problematic corollary of having no set working hours is that all hours are feasibly working hours. Employees can never be sure whether or not their working hours are being monitored by their employer, causing them to internalise this scrutiny and become self-disciplining, with possibly destructive effects. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity and productivity which are cited as the desired results of the unlimited leave policy can all exist independently of worker well-being. I remain doubtful, therefore, as to whether being ‘able to take as much holiday as they want’ is either the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy.",

    "title": "Photographer Vivian Maier\nAlthough Vivian Maier was not famous when she was alive, her photographs are now becoming very popular",
    "text": "When John Maloof bid on a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, little did he know he was stepping deep into the mystery of Vivian Maier. Malloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago, in the US. Instead, what he found were 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images.\nSince then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. Stashed in the attic studio of his home are her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints and 100,000 negatives, as well as many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent weekday morning, Maloof stood in the midst of it all and looked around. He knows he’s on the verge of something pretty cool, and it came about by pure luck. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’\nFor some time now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been stitching together the details of Maier’s life and trying to fill in the blanks. They contacted several local families that employed her as a nanny and talked with employees of the shop where she had film developed. Maier was born in 1926 in new York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who by all accounts kept herself to herself and was a bit of a character, always had a camera with her. She dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes.\n‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be round her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employer Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’\nMaier was knowledgeable about theatre and movies. Although she was by no means sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the street with herm camera and engage people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seems to have been somewhat obsessed with her ‘second job’, documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’\nMaier’s work is the purest form of art; none of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, the abstract. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and he wonders whether she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or was she a lifter of ideas from those who came before her?’\nMaloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives, which he has stored in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures.\n?As I progressed as a photographer and went back and visited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.",

    "text": "I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I knew they went camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking, and these were things I’d never done before. In the NYC you can do different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level you get a certificate.\nWhen I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea; I’d joined that same club when I was eight and I’d found it really difficult to make friends. I was quite shy then and all the other children already had their own friendship groups, so I’d stopped going after a couple of weeks. I decided to take up the challenge though, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate.\nSoon, however, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.\nBecause of what I’ve learnt at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. It wasn’t something I’d ever considered before starting at the club. In fact, I’d never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far and I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping!",

    "text": "I had a ‘year off’. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a magical thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Great as that diversity of activities was, however, there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. All I knew was that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’\nI have always loved the movement of rowing; the way the boat cuts through the water. I was beginning to miss that feeling, but I still wasn’t ready to commit to the regime of training seven days a week. There was, however, a space in my life and mind for some sort of competition. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning it? No. On the other hand, there was part of me that thought the chance to be an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I got in contact with Ben.\nBen was going to take part in the race anyway and had somehow scraped together the considerable entry fee and the deposit for a boat – a fact that made the race a very real possibility, rather than an idle conversation.  We spoke about the remaining costs of the race; the boat and equipment were going to cost £70,000 alone – a huge amount. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it.\nOn top of the expense of doing the race, of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. Of all the ways to earn money as a retired professional sportsman, speaking at business conferences is one of the most profitable. It is flattering that people are interested. But I find it hard talking about something I’ve done without having another major goal. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic.\nI learnt a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full time athlete. Make no mistake, my preparation for the Olympics was tough, my whole life revolving around getting myself in the best possible shape; but looking back it was pretty straightforward. Yes, I was training all day nearly every day, but the training programme was set, there were doctors, dieticians.\nI think if I’m honest, I had concerns over people’s reaction to me doing a race with a TV presenter. I was worried that it would look like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise I would have chosen a better partner to help win the race. My concerns disappeared over the course of our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about far more than just being able to row. This race is more about the mind. Ben had completed the gruelling Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea and a year on a deserted island.\nWhat he can’t do, however, is row. I was shocked by how little natural feel he had for a boat, and he was stunned by my lack of sympathy. I could have shown more patience but there was no point in hiding from Ben the massive improvements he needed to make. I, on the other hand, should have realised that would be his level when I signed up to race with him.",

    "text": "I started playing football when I was 7. I’d rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after a while, I wasn’t a bad player. However, my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so I’m sure they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did.\nIn fact, I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I didn’t believe it at first – I had no idea that young girls could join women’s clubs.  But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old.\nAfter that, I improved enormously. Despite this, people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But the coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then by pure luck, I got the winning goal. As usual, in spite of the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach’s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me round the pitch. Fantastic! \nSince then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are running a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football, and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club. It’ll let them see the professional environment, and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team, if they’re prepared to put in the work. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be prepared for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!",

    "title": "My Canadian trip\nby Louise Walton",
    "text": "Last year I went on an amazing trip – travelling by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He’s also a great fan of boats, although that’s one interest we definitely don’t share. But I’d dreamt of visiting the area ever since seeing it on TV as a child, especially as I knew it was where our great-grandparents had lived before moving to Europe. So I kept asking Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed!\nA few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily the forecast for the time we intended to be there was for calm seas. Although there was plenty to arrange, I was busy at work so didn’t have much time to think about what needed doing. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.\nAfter arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats and set off. The guide had mentioned that very few people now lived along that coast, and sure enough, the only other living creatures we saw on that first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see very far, so I just focussed on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. \nWe often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish, many of which I didn’t recognise. And it was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it really felt like stress-free living!\nWhen the time came to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!",

    "title": "Alice Leader\nFiona Wyton meets the U.S. author Alice Leader, who writes historical novels for children.\n",
    "text": "Alice Leader was standing in front of the remains of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an extraordinary feat of engineering it was by the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 metres high back around 1900 years ago. She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she’d taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn’t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I’m still in touch with children through the fiction.’\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s fiction for children. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she is quick to add, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is spurred on by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It’s all down to me to make it work at that point.’\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was finally inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the seeds lay in the prospect of the ‘empty nest’ approaching as her two sons were leaving home, and an unexpected recommendation from her head teacher that she would enjoy a residential creative writing course. Alice was taken aback. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn’t think was necessary.’\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analysed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his assistance in editing the novel was key. Says Alice, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene. That’s  the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’",

    "title": "The guitar maker\nJonny Kinkead, one of the best known makers of hand-crafted acoustic guitars in the UK, talks about his career",
    "text": "As a boy, when Jonny Kinkead wasn’t making things using the tools in his dad’s garage, he was messing about with a guitar. And the two preoccupations have been his living for the past four decades: building steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still in thrall to the guitar,’ he says. ‘How is it that by simply putting together two planks of wood, you can create a beautiful sound? And by using different combinations of timber, you produce different sounds? Even now, it fills me with wonder.’\nJonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. Then, when he was sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would’ve got a holiday job and saved up for one,’ he says. ‘But I was of a mindset that if you wanted something, you created it yourself. I studied guitars and figured out how different shapes and types of wood affected the sound, and how you could put them together.’\nAlthough the bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, he and his brothers had long been doing essentially the same thing with other items. ‘We drew model boats and aeroplanes and then constructed them, so I was familiar with the process. My father had taught us how to use saws, sharpen chisels, and stuff like that. I’d actually been customising and repairing instruments for my mates, too.’\nJonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but the idea of a career building guitars had yet to cross his mind. ‘I was also into painting and sculpture,’ he says. His interests evolved further and on finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I was interested in, and a career as an architect seemed a good idea at the time,’ he remembers. Halfway through the course, however, he dropped out. ‘I was too individualistic for it,’ he says. ‘But I did leave with a clearer sense of what I wanted to do. I was still into sculpture, but I’d worked out that guitar-building is actually a type of sculpture – one that involves sculpting sound. And I thought it might be a more realistic thing to do than pure art because you’re making things that people use.’\nEver since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he supplemented his income by cleaning windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only went for the cost of the materials, but as he developed a reputation as one of the best guitar-makers around, he was able to charge a little more. But even now, almost forty years later, Jonny describes what he does as ‘still scratching a living’. He admits he can never actually turn out more than ten guitars a year, which inevitably restricts his earnings.\nIn the early years, the key thing was to make the effort to get himself known. He would go to music festivals most weekends if he could and get musicians to try out his guitars and talk about him to their friends. He also had to learn how to price his instruments – when it came up in conversations with musicians, he hadn’t got an answer because focusing on such things didn’t come naturally to him. \nJonny believes developing a career is more straightforward for today’s new guitar-makers in the UK. ‘When I started, a common perception was that the only acoustic guitars worth having were ones made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as the real thing, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses here and the technology and skills involved have remained pretty much constant. But now the quality of our hand-made guitars has the reputation it deserves.’\nJonny says that valuable techniques can be acquired in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should do the courses on offer. He also feels, however, that there is no satisfactory substitute for trial and error. ‘The thing to do is to look at other instruments, see where people have succeeded or failed, and attempt different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t be a good sound. If you’re taught by someone else you only learn one way, but if you’re self-taught, like I was, you learn everything.’",

    "text": "We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van backfired, veered sharply off the road into a field, and shuddered to a halt. John got out and opened up the bonnet. He stood for a long time peering in at the engine with his hands in his pockets and a knowing, not-to-be disturbed look on his face. ‘Actually,’ I haven’t a clue what I’m doing,’ he said eventually, and he and Mum began to giggle.\nBea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field stretched as far as I could see.  There was nothing much in it, just grass and a lot of flowers. Poppies and daisies.\n‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I repeated, because it was always safest to be on Bea’s side.  We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing.\nWe sat on the side of the road and watched John grow smaller and smaller as he went off in search of someone who knew something about cars.\nMum stretched out on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said.\nBea lay down next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’\nSo I told them about how on the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them all the things the birds had talked about.  Breadcrumbs. Other birds. The weather. I told them about the argument they had had over a worm. \n‘That’s stupid, no-one understands bird language,’ Bea said.\nMy eyes stung. ‘I do.’ But my voice didn’t sound very convincing.\n‘Liar.’\nI flushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every single word?  The more I thought about it, the more I wasn’t sure. ‘Mum…?’\nBut she had fallen asleep in the sun.\nJohn had returned with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van along the road to the hotel. Bea refused to get out. The boys didn’t seem to mind at all. They waved and smiled at her through the windows in the back door. We followed John into the tiled café. It was set back from the road and was not far from where our van was now parked.\n‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘I think it might be a bit expensive.’\n‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum reassured him, and we sat down in the shade of the terrace.\nThe tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very, very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup in there,’ she said.\nWe stayed at the café all day while John squinted dismally into the engine. ‘I suppose it’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it began to grow dark.\nMum dragged blankets out onto the road. She made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to go to sleep on ground that wasn’t rushing away from under you.\n‘I’ll have to have us towed into Marrakech,’ John said from the other side of Mum.\nHalf an hour later we were sitting in the truck watching our van trailing behind a rope with John at the wheel. At first Bea hadn’t wanted to move, so John had picked her up and put her in the truck himself. Now she sat in the front with the man who was driving.\nI kept wondering how we’d get home again now that our van had to be dragged everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.",

    "title": "MY JOB – AIRLINE FLIGHT ATTENDANT\nby JACK GRANGER",
    "text": "I won’t pretend being a flight attendant is easy. But since I started the job, I’ve been everywhere, from the US to Australia. I work with incredible people, I have a lot of time off, and life is never boring – which makes it a great job for a young person like me!\nAs a child, I went abroad to a boarding school, away from my family, so I always flew unaccompanied when term began and ended. Feeling lonely, I’d ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers, which some did. And I guess that’s the thing I remembered later, when I needed an  escape from the banking job I was in, and began looking for a new direction.\nThere was a huge variety of young people at the interview, and many were accepted.  They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers. Before the interview, I’d practised what to say – more than simply that I loved to travel, as everyone else would say the same. Instead, I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job! \nI’d recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close.\nWhen I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!",

    "title": "The myth of the disappearing book\nBooks have endured many technical revolutions. So when faced with the transformative power of technology, is the problem often our aversion to change?",
    "text": "From around 2015, after years of sales growth, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had flattened out, or even fallen in some cases, introducing new doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive even admitted recently that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with his company losing too much confidence in ‘the power of the word on the page’. Yet despite the obvious conclusion that digital and print can easily coexist in the market, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book still continues to surface. It doesn’t matter if the intention is to predict or dismiss this possibility; what is significant is the fact that the potential disappearance of the book does not cease to stimulate our imagination or provoke intense debate.\nWhy is this idea so powerful? Why do we frame the encounter between ebooks and print books in terms of a struggle, even if all the evidence is to the contrary? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and tell us much more about the mixture of exhilaration and fear we feel about innovation and change in general. In my research, I have discussed how the idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. After television was invented, for instance, many claimed radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses; people started listening in cars, during train rides and on factory floors.\nEven the idea of the disappearing book isn’t new, either. As early as 1894, there was speculation that the introduction of the phonograph would spell the demise of books: They’d be replaced by what we today call audiobooks. This sort of thing has happened time after time. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks and smartphones – all, at one time or another, have apparently conspired to destroy print books as a source of culture and entertainment. Some claimed the end of books would result in cultural regression and decline. Others, envisioning utopian digital futures, overstated the advantages of ebooks. It is not by chance then that the idea of the death of the book surfaces in moments of technological change. This narrative, in fact, perfectly conveys the mixture of hopes and fears that characterises our deepest reactions to technological change.\nTo understand why these reactions are so common, one has to consider that we create emotional bonds with different media as they become a core part of our life. Numerous studies have shown how we develop a close connection with objects such as books, televisions and computers, even to the extent of giving a name to our car or shouting at our laptop for not working properly. Consequently, the emergence of a new technology – like e-readers – doesn’t just indicate economic and social change. It also causes us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life.\nAs a result, as technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. And it’s why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies. The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, for example, made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened in the shift from analog to digital photography, and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of ‘old’ books – and even for their often unpleasant smell. This should provide some reassurance to those who still worry about the disappearance of print books.\nYet the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide an appealing narrative about both the transformative power of technology and our aversion to change. In fact, one of the strategies we employ in order to make sense of change is the use of narrative patterns that are commonly available and easily recognisable, such as narratives of tragedy and ending. Easy to remember and to spread, the story of the death of the book mirrors both our enthusiasm for what lies ahead, as well as our fear of losing parts of our intimate world – and finally, of ourselves.",

    "title": "How did he do that? \nAmy Wright talks about her meeting with Tony Connor, a cyclist who can do amazing things on a bike",
    "text": "Tony Connor is an example of a new type of celebrity: a big star online but probably unknown to anyone like me who’s not inclined to look at online videos of people doing stunts on bikes. He’s what’s called a ‘street trials cyclist’ - for example, he’ll jump from one seemingly impossible location – a roof, a wall, a ledge of rock – to land safely in another equally strange location. These stunts are filmed and posted online. \nOn the day I interview him, we meet in a BMX park one Saturday morning. The local boys all know exactly who he is, and we break off a few times while quite a few much older people come and pay their respects too, telling him he’s ‘an absolute legend’. Not long afterwards, having witnessed some of his skills, I have to agree with their assessment. Despite coming along with a rather sceptical attitude, I’m taken aback by his courage, imagination and willingness to take risks. When he explains before each stunt about what he’s aiming to do, I can’t always believe he’ll pull it off. However, when I enthusiastically compliment him afterwards, he seems indifferent to my warm words and rather downbeat.\nDespite the fame that his online presence has brought him, Tony admits to being an extremely reluctant celebrity. ‘I find the social side of it difficult. I see the value of being in touch with fans, but instead of discussing things I prefer to actually do them.’ Such an attitude is ironic, given his fame is a product not only of social media but the lightweight camera technology that provides so much of that media’s content. ‘This technology gives people like me an opportunity to make a living,’ he reflects. ‘Sometimes I feel everyone is holding a camera at themselves or staring at a screen and part of me doesn’t go along with that.’ However, he’s not complaining. Through the videos he makes a good living out of what, for someone doing anything similar in the past, would have remained a hobby. \nI’ve realised after many years spent interviewing top athletes that there are two important factors that turn an enthusiastic child into an elite competitor: one is energy, and the other is an ability to accept and get over emotional disappointment. These qualities may count for more than talent and they add up to having the mentality to persist in the face of failure. The riskier the sport, the greater the need is to be able to draw on such reserves of mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times when confronted by what were – by his standards – fairly easy but unfamiliar obstacles. He just dusted himself down and kept going until he’d mastered the job. \nTony isn’t always seen as a hero. Some people claim he’s reckless and takes unnecessary risks. He says, ‘The individuals making these accusations may be genuinely concerned but they aren’t well-informed. For a start, they have probably never ridden a trials bike and know nothing about the sport. They have no clear idea about the technical aspects of what I do and don't realise that I get advice from experts so that the risks are minimised.’   \nAnd in fact Tony is far from casual about the risks he runs. ‘People are all different. Some never get scared and they probably shouldn't be doing these kinds of sports; it’s wise to be aware of the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those that can’t overcome fear and others that can. I’m in the group that feels the fear but finds a way past it. I’m certainly not addicted to risk and spend hours planning and preparing. Sometimes I have to ride around for quite a while to get myself in the right frame of mind before attempting a new stunt. I know I mustn't lose my nerve just before I jump. If I commit myself totally, then I’m fine.’",

    "text": "I’m Tom, I’m fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved into a castle on a small island! It all started when my father was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organisation which looks after historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was pleased, as he felt he wouldn’t be offered such a great chance again, but it was a while before the rest of us agreed Dad should take the job. We were just focused on what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle probably wouldn’t be as comfortable as our cosy home just across the water, and there was no school.\nOnce we’d moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t particularly beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in summer as it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other, though, and help with repairs on the island, which often involves lots of hard work.\nThe biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves – but the ferries don’t run then! And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up!\nBut we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get awful storms, and I wonder sometimes if the castle’s strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for centuries – and it’s still standing!",

    "title": "Living in the modern world",
    "text": "When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic, a job he turned to after becoming disillusioned with office life and his work for social policy institutions. His first book was a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. His most recent one is a kind of philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was out shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine during a delay of just a few seconds while he entered his pin number. \nCrawford says he realised that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. What we want to be at the forefront of our mind at any particular moment is a very personal matter, and we are being prevented from deciding this for ourselves by something which we are, in the main, unaware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think, or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers. ‘We increasingly encounter the world through these representations that are addressed to us, often with manipulative intent: video games, apps on your phone,’ says Crawford. They reflect all our desires perfectly, and end up taking over. \nCrawford is not the only one who is worried. Everyone knows that office worker who complains about emails all day and then spends their free time doing email. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table – a familiar phenomenon to those of us who have sat bored at dinner, feeling the gravitational draw of the black square in our pocket. There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837. But it’s indisputable that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. A world of constant choice means that our powers of self-control are heavily taxed, and this has a social impact. \nWe’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation. By only engaging with representations of people rather than people themselves, Crawford argues, we risk losing something fundamental in our society. And screens are only part of the problem. He gives his gym as an example. There used to be a single music player in the middle of the room, available to everyone. People didn’t all like the same music and that could lead to tension. Now people tend to listen to their own music on ear buds. ‘The gym used to be a social place and it has lost that character. Genuine connection to other people tends to happen in the context of conflict – having a contest of different people’s tastes and working it out,’ he says. \nCrawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player and a motorbike racer as people whose roles force them to deal with material reality. No representation can replicate the feel of the hockey puck on ice, or gravel under your tyres at high speed. Each relies on their good judgment of a complicated subject and the ability to manage the presence of others in the same space.\n‘When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as pale substitutes for the kind of involvement you have with real things,’ he says. ‘They lose some of their grip.’ This is not to suggest that everyone should rush out to chef school; more that it is important to find a way to use your judgment. There are plenty of benefits in addition to professional satisfaction. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes you less able to focus on what matters. The practice of paying attention to one thing, by contrast, makes it easier to pay attention to others.",

    "title": "My film club\nBy Sebastian Walters",
    "text": "My city has a typical modern cinema showing all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s around the corner from where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club! \nWe decided early on that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films in. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we hired an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was freezing cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which means we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit.\nEach time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us, especially now we’ve got our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more concerns about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. \nThe website’s been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve been to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always good to get back to our own club again! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés.  Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience love the special activities we put on with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.",

    "text": "Charlotte Grainger explains that it was her primary school teacher who first speculated that she might write a novel. ‘I thought the height of achievement would be to write a book because it seemed such a challenge and anyway I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like being in the Olympics, for example. When I turned 13 I thought: ‘I may as well attempt this now.’ The novel Charlotte started then is, remarkably, about to be published. ‘Recently I told my ex-teacher about it and she was astonished. She told me she’d meant I’d probably do it when I was 30 or 40. That had never occurred to me – I couldn’t understand why I’d be expected to put something on hold that I had a chance of being good at.’\nIt’s a winter afternoon, in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew that I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still momentarily thrown by seeing a teenager sitting there. The book is a huge achievement: the narrative is assured and action packed. Nothing about it, except the age of its heroine, suggests that it was written by a teenager. The public relations representative for the book is keeping us company in case Charlotte might need defending. But she needs neither parental nor professional support. She’s her own person: spirited, with an alert face and a lively intelligence, but also a steadiness that prevents any overconfidence she could be forgiven for feeling.\nCharlotte acknowledges the limitations of her youth. I ask her about the sophisticated moral issues she raises. ‘I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. There aren’t many life lessons I can pass on to my readers,’ she responds, laughing. ‘I don’t think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but neither do I believe I’m particularly wise. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.’\nShe has a theory about teenagers and the way they are ‘betrayed’ by the fiction that is specifically aimed at them. There are, she maintains, three types of teenager depicted in novels. ‘There’s the outsider who becomes acceptable to society, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the big wide world, and the awkward teenage character who isn’t socially skilled.’ Repeatedly reading about these character types irritated her. ‘What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories out there about characters who aren’t inadequate in some way. The overall impression teenagers can get from some writers – and I don’t think it’s intentional – is teenagers can’t possibly know who they are because they’re not experienced enough to know the truth. And when that is being pushed on them by writers, it can undermine their self-belief’.\nCharlotte has always been a keen reader of famous fantasy writers, some of whom you might suppose she’d be indebted to, but in fact they almost put her off writing entirely. ‘Books by my favourite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and about life. I was asking myself: is this seriously what I have to be doing to write a good book and am I really up to it?’ She does, however, praise the influence of a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ‘It tells you that if the reader starts to guess what’s going to happen, the suspense has probably gone.’\nIt would be easy to argue that Charlotte’s parents both being journalists was the decisive factor in getting her novel published. Indeed, her father’s acquaintance with someone in publishing was what got her book read initially. She acknowledges her good fortune, because getting anyone to read a first novel is hard, whatever the age of the author. ‘Every aspiring writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that you’re on your own. Ultimately writers sink or swim according to their talents so I don’t take things for granted,’ Charlotte concludes.",

    "title": "Kith by Jay Griffiths – a review by Mary Beard",
    "text": "A recent international report reveals that a large proportion of children currently living in wealthy industrialised countries feel ‘out of place’, lonely, and dissatisfied. Jay Griffiths’ question is simple: why do today’s children feel so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths offers an explanation: these children have been cooped up indoors, imprisoned in front of their screens, whether television or computer, and they have lost all contact with the natural world – with the woods and the wilds, the mountains and moors, the rivers and streams. That, she argues, is the heart of the problem.\nIt’s a diagnosis that chimes with other discussions of contemporary childhood. A follow-up study to the report interviewed a sample of children to explore their malaise more carefully. It did not find these kids longing miserably for the next bit of hi-tech gadgetry; a large number said that they would be happier if they could simply go outside more. And many of today’s over-40s talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth: how they spent long summer days wandering down disused railway lines, swimming in ponds, or making dens in tumbledown sheds. This was so much better and healthier, they insist, than the protected life of the younger generation now. Of course, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the very ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children: no dens in tumbledown sheds for them – think of the risks.\nThere is a good deal of sharp argument in Griffiths’ book. She is excellent, for example, on the relationship between the ‘contemporary hysteria’ about dangers facing children in the outdoor world and child-focused consumerism. The fear of danger that makes parents want to keep kids at home clearly plays into the hands of the toy and gadget industry, eager to flog them entertainments to keep their house-bound charges amused.\nShe also has some spirited paragraphs on recent trends such as the tendency to prescribe medication as a ‘cure’ for fidgeting, restless children, or to insist that kids wear goggles to take part in traditional playground games. I am never quite sure how widespread such ridiculous regulations really are, and suspect that they are closer to urban myths than to standard practice. But, widespread or not, Griffiths conveys her indignation with engaging eloquence, just as she is eloquently inspirational about other aspects of childhood freedoms and constraints, from fairy tales to school rules.\nAppealing as these arguments are, the trouble is that Griffiths just doesn’t know when to stop. It’s a classic case of a good idea pursued much too far, and of key counter-arguments being brushed under the carpet – so far under the carpet that at one particularly silly moment she likens the modern treatment of children to a subtle form of racism. ‘It’s really ugly,’ she declares.\nPart of the problem is that, on the topic of kids, Griffiths is an unashamed romantic. Despite a few token gestures in the opposite direction (‘Children can be mavericks of malice’, she concedes at one point), for the most part she holds an idealised, rosy and one-sided view of their nature – one that would hardly survive any prolonged face-to-face experience of a boisterous gang of under-10s. Try telling the average parent that, as Griffiths puts it, ‘children are the musicians of thought’. Maybe that is how kids would be, if only they were given the space to be so; but I very much doubt it.\nPerhaps the most important theme of the book is the idea that children should be allowed their autonomy, to roam, to explore the wild woods of their home territory, and, crucially, to take risks. Griffiths believes that kids cannot know how to manage risk unless they have experienced some danger. ‘Children need accidents,’ Griffiths writes, ‘little ones, ideally, accidents the right size, through which they learn to avoid bigger accidents later.’ The problem is that she gives no hint about how we might achieve accidents of ‘the right size’. And, anyway, are we so sure that all children want to follow the ‘wild’ model that Griffiths admires? What, I wondered, of the naturally timid, the stay-at-homes, the quiet and the cautious? Maybe the real crime people commit against children is to force them all into the same space – whether that’s to pen them in, or push them out.",

    "title": "Food Matters\nAn introduction to the philosophy of food",
    "text": "Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who treasure food might expect that critical reflection on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. Historically however, philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to gaining insight into other philosophical issues. So when philosophers have talked of eating, it has actually served as a metaphor for some other topic, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that do appear superficially to be about food. However, further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. \nIt is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but did so across a range of human activities. Nonetheless, the name of Epicurus has grown synonymous with a passion for eating and drinking; in addition to casual speech, we see it invoked in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites, among others. Presumably these commercial interests expect some return if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers. \nWhatever else food is, it is inherently social and cultural. The food that we eat does not appear from nowhere, but rather derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\nOnce food has been prepared, critics will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected since, philosophically, the perception mechanisms underlying taste have not received much attention. Nearly all of the literature on perception has focussed on vision and this should be remedied. \nAnother aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit. \nThere are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. Most generally, we can ask what should we eat: organic; free-range; locally grown; vegetarian; foods that are not genetically modified? Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food. \nA separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks, it seems to me, have a special duty to their guests generated by the direct relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included as we come together to share food and companionship. Those who cook for a living, on the other hand, have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. This means that their kitchens are not open to all, but only those who are suitably qualified, and their relationships are those of colleagues, not friends. \nA recent essay titled ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ examines the ways in which food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. This takes place in two ways. First, we can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food. Second, we forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat – a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. But what is so unexpected is that the text is fleshed out by many wonderful examples and entertaining anecdotes, which brings to life for the general reader this aspect of food philosophy.",

    "text": "When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried organised group trips before. My brother, who I’d previously travelled with, was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although obviously still puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile.\nOur group had exchanged emails before we set off, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained a support boat would accompany us throughout, and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. \nWe did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim and I was nervous. I’d trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not at all where I’d hoped. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own.\nThe following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.",

    "title": "Views from the summit\nStephen E. Schmid, US Professor of philosophy and experienced rock climber, explores the motivations of climbers and mountaineers",
    "text": "‘Because it’s there,’ the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have responded to a reporter’s question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. The reporter, in forming his inquiry, was undoubtedly expressing a common sentiment: the general public has an unending desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams; it challenges a certain type of person to face the unknown. Yet its real merit lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.\nAn important essay on climbing is ‘Games that Climbers Play’, 1967, by the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven distinct climbing activities, or ‘games’, from playing around on boulders to scaling Himalayan peaks, each with its own set of rules. And he maintained that the style used to tackle any climb – for example, using more or less equipment – has to depend on the rules of that particular game. Over the intervening years, this approach to climbing has rightly come to dominate climbing discourse in the West as it is expressed in everything from climbing magazines to fire-side debates.\nFor many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom. \nWhen presented with the question ‘Why climb?’ the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction in his recent essay. Fitschen argues that a better question would be ‘Why do people climb?’ This way, Fitschen asks about our species and gives an evolutionary explanation for why we climb. Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits, even if there are risks involved. Thus the pleasures we get from climbing have more to do with biology than any rational process. \nAnother significant contribution was made in a recent essay by US academic Brian Treanor, who proposes that climbing helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. While Treanor acknowledges that these are not the only favourable characteristics that climbing has the potential to develop, and that not all climbers exhibit these virtues, he thinks developing these virtues is particularly important in our modernized and risk-averse world. Climbing, then, serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world. \nOne further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed. Expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson caused a degree of controversy by claiming it is because the climb is harder or riskier when done independently that such climbing achievements deserve greater recognition than those completed by large teams or aided by artificial means, such as bottled oxygen supplies at high altitude. The crux of the issue seems to have been that the essay may have encouraged some in the climbing fraternity to expose themselves to unnecessary dangers. \nIt is also possible to inquire into climbing by leaving the Western tradition. Being in the moment, in the zone, or going with the flow are all common experiences reported by climbers. The physical work involved on a climb, the active meditation while on a route and the problem solving that is intuitive rather than logical, are all fundamental parts of climbing. So much so that it has been argued that the discipline of climbing parallels many of the techniques used in Zen philosophy to train the mind towards reaching a state of perfect peace. In this, then, people may find one further idea to consider when asking why men and women are drawn to climbing.",

    "title": "Talking about the weather\nThe anthropologist Kate Fox explains why the English talk about the weather.",
    "text": "Any discussion of English conversation, like any English conversation, must begin with the weather. And in this spirit of observing traditional procedure, I shall, like every other writer on Englishness, quote the famous comment of the eighteenth-century diarist Dr Johnson that, ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’, and point out that this observation is as accurate now as it was over two hundred years ago.\nThis, however, is the point at which most commentators either stop or try, and fail, to come up with a convincing explanation for the English ‘obsession’ with the weather. They fail because they start with this mistaken premise: they assume that our conversations about the weather are actually conversations about the weather. In other words, they assume that English people talk about the weather because they have a keen interest in the subject. Most commentators try to figure out what it is about the English weather that is so fascinating.\nThe American writer Bill Bryson, for example, observes that the English weather is not at all fascinating, and therefore that the national obsession with it is inexplicable: ‘To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it. All those phenomena that elsewhere give nature an edge of excitement, unpredictability and danger – tornadoes, monsoons, raging blizzards, huge hailstorms – are almost wholly unknown in the British Isles.’\nThe English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman objects to Bryson’s dismissive comments, and argues that English weather is actually fascinating. ‘Bryson misses the point. The English fixation with the weather is nothing to do with deep emotion – like the English countryside, it is, for the most part, dramatically undramatic. The interest is less in the phenomena themselves but in its uncertainty…one of those things you can say about England with absolute certainty is that it has a lot of weather. It may not include tropical cyclones, but life at the edge of an ocean and the edge of a continent means you can never be entirely sure what you are going to get.’\nMy research has convinced me that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the point, which is that our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all: English weather-speak is a kind of code, evolved to help English people overcome their natural reserve and actually talk to each other. Everyone knows, for example, that ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’, ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ and other variations on the theme are not requests for meteorological data: they are fixed greetings, conversation starters or fillers to fall back on in conversations. In other words, English weather-speak is a form of ‘grooming talk’ – the human equivalent of what is known as ‘social grooming’ among monkeys and apes, who spend hours grooming each other’s fur, even when it is perfectly clean, as a means of social bonding.\nThere are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used. Other writers have claimed that the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is an inaccurate observation: in fact, there are three quite specific contexts in which weather-speak is prescribed. It can be used as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters or as a ‘default’ or ‘filler’ topic when conversation on other matters dries up and there is an embarrassing pause or uncomfortable silence. Admittedly, this does allow for rather a lot of weather-speak – so outsiders gain the impression that English people talk of little else. An English conversation may well start with a weather-speak greeting, progress to a bit more weather-speak ice-breaking, and then ‘default’ to weather-speak at regular intervals. It is easy to see why people of other nationalities, and even many English commentators, have assumed that English people must be obsessed with the subject.",

    "title": "Looking back at the Wimbledon tennis championships",
    "text": "The silence, that’s what strikes you when you play on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships. You bounce the ball soundlessly up and down on the soft grass surface; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and you hear the echo of your own shot. And of every shot after that. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, the respectful crowds, all combine to enclose and cushion you from the outside world. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for my game. What I battle against hardest in a tennis match is to shut everything out of my mind but the contest itself and the point I’m playing.\nThe silence of the Centre Court is broken by a shock of noise when a point’s done: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but as if from some place far off. I don’t register that there are fifteen thousand people hunched around the arena, tracking every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused I have no sense at all that there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life.\nI had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach all my life, had drummed into me from an early age that this was the biggest tournament of them all. By the time I was 14, I was sharing with my friends the fantasy that I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, though, I’d played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final there the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. I went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that, having just turned twenty, I’d made it that far. Federer beat me pretty easily, more easily than if I’d gone out with more belief. But my defeat in 2007 left me utterly destroyed. I knew I could have done better, that it was not my ability or the quality of my game that had failed me, but my head. I wept after that loss. I cried incessantly for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts much more when you have a chance and throw it away.\nToni, the toughest of tennis coaches, is usually the last person in the world to offer me consolation; he criticizes me even when I win. It is a measure of what a wreck I must have been that he abandoned the habit of a lifetime and told me there was no reason to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and more Wimbledon finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this had probably been my last chance to win it. I am keenly aware of how short the life of a professional athlete is, and I want to make the best of it while it lasts. Every single moment counts but some moments count for more than others, and I had let a big one pass in 2007.\nThere was nothing Toni could do to ease my grief. Yet he turned out, in the end, to be right. Another chance had come my way. Here I was again in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I’d learnt the lesson from that defeat twelve months earlier; that whatever else gave way this time, my head would not. The best sign that my head was in the right place now was the conviction that I would win.\nAt dinner with family and friends and team members the night before the final, at the house we always rent when I play at Wimbledon, mention of the match had been off limits. I didn’t expressly forbid them from raising the subject, but they all understood well enough that, whatever else I might have been talking about, I was already beginning to play the match in a space inside my head. From here on in until the start of play, that space should remain mine alone.",

    "title": "How my electric guitar found its way home",
    "text": "Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways.\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That’s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn’t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears. I think I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was very fair. I’d forgotten all about my dad’s annoying habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. How Dad would have laughed to hear about this strange series of events!\nMy mum and dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar: it was the 1970s and classical guitarists were very popular. I loved the sound of the instrument: so calming, so gentle – and so flattering to the learner. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound awful in the hands of a beginner. But the truth was, I couldn’t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. This was not just the era of the classical guitar; it was also the time of punk music, when people who  weren’t able to play their instruments well could be rock stars.\nWhen I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith had sent to me, I had a sudden, vivid memory of my birthday, back in 1978, when my smiling parents presented the instrument to me. Picking it up again, it felt so fascinatingly smooth, dense, yet smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then instantly felt the need to stand up, putting a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar demands to be played in this position. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it. My middle-aged, fleshy fingertips felt that special pain of holding down the wires to play a chord.\nThe electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I guess I’ll have to form a band. My son’s learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves \n‘The Regainers’!",

    "title": "A priceless discovery",
    "text": "I bought my first metal detector soon after I was married - £70 was a lot of money then, and would probably have been better spent on something sensible for the house. Still, my wife, Marion, couldn't help but be impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've uncovered has given me pleasure - that sense of being connected to the past is one I've always found satisfying. But after the gold ring, 40 years passed before I made another discovery that impressed Marion as much. \nIt was a dull February afternoon and I had a couple of hours to spare and a location in mind. But it was raining, so I decided to to settle for a closer spot I knew to contain mainly old farming machinery. The first time my detector bleeped, I uncovered a fragment of a metal wheel. Then, as the detector swung on my arm it bleeped again. I tried to ignore it, but couldn't walk away without knowing for sure. \nI'd dug down half a metre and was on my stomach in the mud when a rounded, golden ball became visible. Having dug up brass curtain rails in the past, I tried to keep my expectations in check. But as I brushed more dirt away, the ball resolved itself into a fat, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared. Eventually, I remembered to breathe. I'd seen something like this before - the Great Torc, on display in the British Museum. It’s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain - a period over 2,000 years ago. Torc means ‘twist’ and it's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring just like the one I was looking at. \nI carried it to the car. At every junction on the drive home, I stared at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. A rinse in my kitchen sink was\nprobably the only clean the torc had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. ‘What is it?’ she said after a few moments. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery.\nNeither of us tried the torc on; the risk of damaging it was too great. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We'd never been burgled, but anxiety made me restless.  Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office and hid it underneath. The law states that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days of discovery. I was determined to enjoy the torc as much as possible before I gave it up - I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in hospital. Finally, I carried it into the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone as I placed the torc on his desk, and had his back to me. He turned, still talking, then stopped in mid-sentence. \nThe torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's currently in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself. But the torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say to me, ‘Now you've made such a fabulous find, I suppose you're going to stop detecting.’ But those brooches and coins are no less interesting now. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop - not while there's the chance of a bigger fish tomorrow. ",

    "title": "The Ascent of Science",
    "text": "At its most abstract, science shades into philosophy; at its most practical it cures disease. It has eased our lives and threatened our existence. It aspires, but in some very basic way fails, to understand the ant and the origins of the universe, the infinitesimal atom and the mind-bludgeoning immensity of the cosmos. It has laid its hand on the shoulders of poets and politicians, philosophers and charlatans. Its beauty is often apparent only to the initiated, its perils are generally misunderstood, its importance has been both over and underestimated, and its fallibility, and that of those who create it, is often glossed over or malevolently exaggerated.\nThe attempt to explain the physical universe has been characterized by perpetual conflict. Established theories have continually been modified or violently overthrown, and as in the history of music, innovations tend to be ridiculed only to become, in time, the new dogma. The struggle between old and new has rarely been dignified. Scientists come in many colors, of which the green of jealousy and the purple of rage are fashionable shades. The essence of scientific history has been conflict.\nThis book presents science as a series of ideas that changed the course not only of science itself but often of whole areas of human thought. Science, of course, has its practical benefits, but they will not be our primary concern. This is not a book about non-stick frying pans. We will be looking at ideas – admiring their beauty, occasionally standing awestruck before the towers of imagination, but always being prepared to doubt; always being aware not only of the ingenuity but also of the deep limitations, and the repeatedly demonstrable inertia, of the human mind.\nScience, by its nature, is changeable. There is always some scientist, somewhere, who is disproving an explanation that another scientist has proposed. Usually these shifts of interpretation leave the fabric of society undisturbed. Occasionally, however, real revolutions tear down part of our system of established beliefs. Thus, in the seventeenth century, science presented us with a mechanical universe, a giant inexorable clock. Three centuries later, physics has questioned some basic assumptions, leading us into a shadowy maze where we affect the universe by the act of observing it and are ignorant of the true meaning of our most basic concepts.\nSome see the fragility of scientific theory as an indication of a basic inability of science to explain the universe. But scientific change is almost always accompanied by an increase in our ability to rationalize and predict the course of nature. The seventeenth-century English scientist Isaac Newton could explain far more than the Ancient Greek polymath Aristotle, and Albert Einstein, the father of modern physics, more than Newton. Science frequently stumbles, but it gets up and carries on. The road is long. It is prudent to recall that at the end of the nineteenth century the general opinion amongst physicists was that nothing of any great import remained to be done in physics. And then came radioactivity, X-rays, the discovery of the electron and the nucleus, a couple of hundred new fundamental particles, quantum mechanics and relativity, antimatter, dark matter, black holes, chaos, the Big Bang, and so on. Biology has been no less prolific. At present, there are again voices proclaiming the imminent arrival of a theory of everything, a complete explanation of the origins of the universe and workings of the cosmos. Maybe.\nScience is not a harmless intellectual pastime. In the last two centuries we have moved from being simply observers of nature to being, in a modest but growing way, its controllers. Concomitantly, we have occasionally disturbed the balance of nature in ways that we did not always understand. Science has to be watched. Non-scientists can no longer afford to stand to one side, ignorant of the meaning of advances that will determine the kind of world that their children will inhabit – and the kind of children that they will have. Science has become part of the human race’s way of conceiving of and manipulating its future. The manipulation of the future is not a question to be left to  philosophers. The answers can affect the national budget, the health of your next child – even the long-term prospects for life on this planet.",

    "title": "The new board games\nReporter Mark Wilding looks into the legacy board games phenomenon",
    "text": "Rob Daviau, from the US, designs ‘legacy’ board games. Feeling that the traditional board games he had played as a child were no longer entertaining or challenging enough, he started to wonder how board games might evolve. Could they have a storyline? Could decisions made in one session carry over into another? He adapted a classic board game called Risk creating  a new, ‘legacy’ version: Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, for the first time, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or at key moments open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game. Daviau explained: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’ \nDaviau was then asked to collaborate on a legacy version of Pandemic, the hugely popular co-operative board game title in which players try to cure diseases threatening humanity. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy attracted widespread acclaim, SeaFall was seen by many as the true test of the legacy format – the first title that did not follow on from an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become seafarers as they set out to conquer a previously unexplored world. \nLegacy board game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the narrative doesn’t fall apart. To do this, designers recruit testers so they can observe how board games will unfold. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester on SeaFall. ‘It takes an insane amount of time,’ he said. ‘You’ll have a situation where it’s playing great, the first few games are perfect, then four or five games in it starts to get shaky, then game six it’s broken. Then you have to go back and redo everything.’ \nLegacy board games were never expected to go mainstream. When developing the concept, even Daviau suspected it would be a niche pursuit. ‘When I was working on it I would think: “This is really different and I think it’s pretty good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s weird, it’s unexpected and it breaks a lot of taboos. I expected it to be very successful with a handful of people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this weird project.’\nNevertheless, most players, like Russell Chapman, loved the concept. He sees it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. ‘It’s this new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than to learn a new game or way to do something and you’re getting that constantly with legacy games.’ \nAccording to another fan, Ben Hogg, the appeal of an unfolding adventure trumped any concerns about longevity. ‘There was that initial apprehension about making changes and basically wrecking your board as you went through,’ he said. ‘That has been put to bed by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t go to the cinema to watch the same film twice, do they? You’re buying into an experience. It’s introducing that aspect of narrative that you get from video games.’\nThe legacy format draws not only on video games but the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series. While at college, Daviau saw his future as a television writer, but moved into advertising, then game design. Nevertheless, the appeal of telling stories stuck with him. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock likens the legacy design process to writing a novel. ‘You need to have an idea of how you want it to end and a pretty good idea of where you want it to begin,’ he said. ‘But also it’s not enough just to have an overall outline.’\nWhile Daviau feels a sense of ownership, he is keen to see where others take the idea. But he also seeks to play down its significance. He suspects gamers will soon be asking: ‘Enough of that, what’s new?’ Colby Dauch, studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less sure. For him, the legacy format has been a revelation. ‘It’s the kind of idea that changes the way you think about what a board game can be.’",

    "title": "US Photography",
    "text": "Few inventions have so completely changed the course of civilisation, let alone our whole way of knowing the world, as photography. And this has been especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of US culture at every level – from the practical and scientific, to the industrial, to the aesthetic, not to mention a whole world of amusement and entertainment that opened up with the advent of the camera. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work loomed so large. This is indeed a large claim, but it reflects our sense that photography has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse and means that we must, to appreciate its impact fully, examine its beginnings in the mid-19th century.\nWhy was this new art so appealing? Firstly, the very fact that photography was a mechanical process matched a growing enthusiasm for technology, part of a national mentality that accepted change as a fact of life. And just as steam power, railroads and electricity made the world smaller by enhancing the means of communication and travel, so did photography bring the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that was breathtaking.\nSecondly, the camera was the instrument of choice when opting for a tool which would best represent the self, capable of presenting an image for public consumption in a country where it was taken as a given that individual and national identities were always to be invented and reinvented. And thirdly, as an instrument for creating and sustaining an impression of self and family, the camera has also been hugely important, a means of endowing the family with a record of its own, even if a somewhat idealised one. And finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was in harmony aesthetically with a tendency towards realism and the representation of everyday realities that we find in the work of US artists. \nAny photograph is a way of calling attention to something, a picture of what a photographer wants us to look at; and every picture is implicitly saying, This, you should see! The fact that the picture is an image made by a machine, as opposed to, say, a drawing, adds a unique characteristic: photographs are records of events, of people, of things; records – at the very least – of what was in front of the camera, and as such the photograph embodies a certain objectivity. And yet, as the product of a particular individual taking the photograph, the image may also be said to carry with it an inescapable element of a point of view, a subjectivity.\nWe may look at a photograph and think – because we recognize the subject, let’s say – that we know what the photograph means: consequently photography has been hailed since its beginnings as a ‘universal language’. But photographic meaning is more complex than that. There are few things standing before us – whether a person, a thing, or an event – that speak their own meaning; and no image is ever presented to us without some frame of information that influences our understanding of it – whether it is a caption in a newspaper, or a layout on a magazine page, or its placement on a gallery wall or in the pages of a book. If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix: Why did the photographer make the image? How did people first see it? And to complicate matters further, the same image might be seen in several places and times and its meaning would accordingly be different for each one. \nIf the camera’s importance to the artist was kept secret for a long time, it is now, for the contemporary artist, anything but a secret. For the last several decades, beginning with the U.S. artist Andy Warhol’s exploitation of the photograph in individual paintings, silk screens, and multiples, artists have been incorporating photographs into their work in a variety of ways. In short, photographic vision, if we can call it that, has come to seem not at odds with painting in the history of art, but the indispensable accessory to painting, integral to our notions of representation before the invention of the camera.",
