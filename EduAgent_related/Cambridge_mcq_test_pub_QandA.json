If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.  The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.  The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves, which are sometimes dyed a brilliant gold.  Meanwhile, in the garden, buds appear on flowers, and colourful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the subtle transition from one season to the next.\nSince the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories.  My pattern has been this: once I finish a novel, I find I want to write some short stories; once a group of short stories is done, then I feel like focusing on a novel.  I never write any short stories while I’m writing a novel, and never write a novel while I’m working on short stories.  The two types of writing may very well engage different parts of the brain, and it takes some time to get off one track and switch to the other.\nIt was only after I began my career with two short novels in 1975 that I started, from 1984 to 1985, to write short stories.  I knew little about short-story writing then so it was rough going, but I did find the experience really memorable.  I felt the possibilities of my fictional world expand by several degrees.  And readers seemed to appreciate this other side of me as a writer.  One of my earliest works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.  This was my starting point as a short-story writer.\nOne of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take so long to finish.  Generally it takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape (though revisions can be endless).  It’s not like the total physical and mental commitment you have to make for the year or two it takes to compose a novel.  You go into a room, finish your work, and leave.  That’s it.  For me, at least, writing a novel can seem to drag on for ever, and I sometimes wonder if I’m going to survive.  So I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace.\nOne more nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story out of the smallest things – an idea that springs up in your mind, a word, an image, whatever.  In most cases it’s like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to.  And another good point is that with short stories you don’t have to worry about failing.  If the idea doesn’t work out the way you hoped it would, you just shrug your shoulders and tell yourself that they can’t all be winners.  Even with masters of the genre like the American writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver, not every short story is a masterpiece.  I find this a great comfort.  You can learn from your mistakes (in other words, those you cannot call a complete success) and use that in the next story you write.  In my case, when I write novels I try very hard to learn from the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories.  In that sense the short story is a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist.  It is hard to experiment the way I like to do inside the framework of a novel, so without short stories I know I would find the task of writing novels even more difficult and demanding.\nMy short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind.  I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did.

It explains how the two processes complement each other and how each form of writing brings its own unique characteristics.\n\n3. **Understanding the Purpose of the Metaphor**: The writer uses these metaphors to illustrate the relationship between his writing styles. He suggests that while novels require a significant effort and a longer period of time, short stories offer a more joyful and quicker process.\n\n4. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **(A)** This option suggests the writer uses the metaphor to suggest that his novels and short stories are parts of a whole. However, the passage does not indicate that novels and short stories are parts of a unified whole.\n   - **(B)** This option states the writer uses the metaphor to point out the need to read novels and short stories in different ways. While there is a difference in the process and enjoyment, the passage does not emphasize the need to read them differently.\n   - **(C)** This option highlights the difficulty in differentiating between novels and short stories. The passage actually emphasizes the complementary nature and ease of short stories compared to novels, suggesting that differentiation is not necessarily difficult.\n   - **(D)** This option implies the writer uses the metaphor to emphasize that writing novels and short stories come naturally to him. The passage describes the writer's consistent alternation between the two forms of writing, but does not suggest that the act of writing them is inherently natural or effortless.\n\nGiven the context provided and the analysis, the most fitting answer is **(C)**.\n\n**Final Answer: (C) to highlight the difficulty of trying to differentiate between his novels and short stories.**",

Generally it takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape (though revisions can be endless).\"\n\n2. **Contextual Analysis**: The reference passage also includes a section that discusses the author's early short stories, saying: \"I knew little about short-story writing then so it was rough going, but I did find the experience really memorable. One of my earliest works, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.\"\n\n3. **Core Question**: The question asks what the writer says about his first short stories. Given the information provided, the writer states that his early short stories were \"rough going,\" indicating a challenging process.\n\n4. **Evaluate Options**:\n   - Option (A) suggests his relative inexperience showed in them. This aligns with the statement \"I knew little about short-story writing then.\"\n   - Option (B) implies readers were pleasantly surprised by them. There's no mention of reader reaction in the given text.\n   - Option (C) talks about opening up new creative opportunities. While the writer notes that the experience was memorable, there's no indication it led to new creative opportunities.\n   - Option (D) mentions that writing them was trickier than he had expected. This aligns with the phrase \"I knew little about short-story writing then.\"\n\nGiven these analyses, both options (A) and (D) fit the description provided in the passage.

If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.  The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.  The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves, which are sometimes dyed a brilliant gold.  Meanwhile, in the garden, buds appear on flowers, and colourful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the subtle transition from one season to the next.\nSince the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories.  My pattern has been this: once I finish a novel, I find I want to write some short stories; once a group of short stories is done, then I feel like focusing on a novel.  I never write any short stories while I’m writing a novel, and never write a novel while I’m working on short stories.  The two types of writing may very well engage different parts of the brain, and it takes some time to get off one track and switch to the other.\nIt was only after I began my career with two short novels in 1975 that I started, from 1984 to 1985, to write short stories.  I knew little about short-story writing then so it was rough going, but I did find the experience really memorable.  I felt the possibilities of my fictional world expand by several degrees.  And readers seemed to appreciate this other side of me as a writer.  One of my earliest works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.  This was my starting point as a short-story writer.\nOne of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take so long to finish.  Generally it takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape (though revisions can be endless).  It’s not like the total physical and mental commitment you have to make for the year or two it takes to compose a novel.  You go into a room, finish your work, and leave.  That’s it.  For me, at least, writing a novel can seem to drag on for ever, and I sometimes wonder if I’m going to survive.  So I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace.\nOne more nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story out of the smallest things – an idea that springs up in your mind, a word, an image, whatever.  In most cases it’s like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to.  And another good point is that with short stories you don’t have to worry about failing.  If the idea doesn’t work out the way you hoped it would, you just shrug your shoulders and tell yourself that they can’t all be winners.  Even with masters of the genre like the American writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver, not every short story is a masterpiece.  I find this a great comfort.  You can learn from your mistakes (in other words, those you cannot call a complete success) and use that in the next story you write.  In my case, when I write novels I try very hard to learn from the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories.  In that sense the short story is a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist.  It is hard to experiment the way I like to do inside the framework of a novel, so without short stories I know I would find the task of writing novels even more difficult and demanding.\nMy short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind.

If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.  The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.  The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves, which are sometimes dyed a brilliant gold.  Meanwhile, in the garden, buds appear on flowers, and colourful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the subtle transition from one season to the next.\nSince the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories.  My pattern has been this: once I finish a novel, I find I want to write some short stories; once a group of short stories is done, then I feel like focusing on a novel.  I never write any short stories while I’m writing a novel, and never write a novel while I’m working on short stories.  The two types of writing may very well engage different parts of the brain, and it takes some time to get off one track and switch to the other.\nIt was only after I began my career with two short novels in 1975 that I started, from 1984 to 1985, to write short stories.  I knew little about short-story writing then so it was rough going, but I did find the experience really memorable.  I felt the possibilities of my fictional world expand by several degrees.  And readers seemed to appreciate this other side of me as a writer.  One of my earliest works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.  This was my starting point as a short-story writer.\nOne of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take so long to finish.  Generally it takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape (though revisions can be endless).  It’s not like the total physical and mental commitment you have to make for the year or two it takes to compose a novel.  You go into a room, finish your work, and leave.  That’s it.  For me, at least, writing a novel can seem to drag on for ever, and I sometimes wonder if I’m going to survive.  So I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace.\nOne more nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story out of the smallest things – an idea that springs up in your mind, a word, an image, whatever.  In most cases it’s like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to.  And another good point is that with short stories you don’t have to worry about failing.  If the idea doesn’t work out the way you hoped it would, you just shrug your shoulders and tell yourself that they can’t all be winners.  Even with masters of the genre like the American writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver, not every short story is a masterpiece.  I find this a great comfort.  You can learn from your mistakes (in other words, those you cannot call a complete success) and use that in the next story you write.  In my case, when I write novels I try very hard to learn from the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories.  In that sense the short story is a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist.  It is hard to experiment the way I like to do inside the framework of a novel, so without short stories I know I would find the task of writing novels even more difficult and demanding.\nMy short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind.  I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did.  Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) explaining his working practice.",

By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives – when they slept and ate and worked and worried – I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,’ the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote. I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.’\nIn that sense, this is a superficial book. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. (The novelist John Cheever thought that you couldn’t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self – isn’t that the truth?) My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me? \nI don’t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages – probably some of them can’t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises – but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \nThe book’s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people’s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot. But in the right hands, your daily routine can be a finely calibrated mechanism for taking advantage of a range of limited resources: time (the most limited resource of all) as well as willpower and optimism. A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. The psychologist William James thought you wanted to put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a chronic procrastinator and could never stick to a regular schedule. \nAs it happens, it was an inspired bout of procrastination that led to the creation of this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I’m a classic ‘morning person’, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers’ working schedules. These were easy to find and highly entertaining. It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place – hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people’s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I’ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. In other cases, I have cobbled together a summary of their routines from secondary sources. I should note here that this book would have been impossible without the research of the hundreds of biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I drew upon. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) make great people seem more like the average person.

He focuses on:\n\n* **Routine:** The author is interested in the routines of these individuals, not just their achievements.\n* **Personal struggles:** He addresses his own struggles with balancing creative work and daily life, suggesting a personal connection to the subject.\n* **Examples:** He uses examples of their routines to illustrate how they manage their time and energy, ultimately trying to understand their success.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) show how creativity cannot be planned for:** The author doesn't argue against the possibility of creativity. He's interested in how people manage their time and routines to achieve it.\n* **(B) make great people seem more like the average person:** The author is not trying to make them seem ordinary. He's highlighting the commonalities in their routines, which are often overlooked.\n* **(D) demonstrate how successful careers depend on self-discipline:** While discipline is a factor, the author's focus is broader, encompassing routines, habits, and the impact of daily life on creative output.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any other aspects of the passage! \n",

He described these subjects as \"creatures of habit\" and sought to portray them as relatable figures.\n\n3. **Compare the options with the analysis**:\n   - **Option (A)**: \"show how creativity cannot be planned for.\"\n     This does not align with the author's intention, as the passage focuses on the mundane details rather than creativity being unplanned.\n   - **Option (B)**: \"make great people seem more like the average person.\"\n     This is somewhat related, but the passage emphasizes understanding and portraying great people through their mundane habits, rather than just making them seem average.\n   - **Option (C)**: \"try to understand why great people lived the way they did.\"\n     This is closely aligned with the author's intent. He explains that by studying their daily lives, he hopes to gain insights into their behaviors and how they managed their time and creativity.\n   - **Option (D)**: \"demonstrate how successful careers depend on self-discipline.\"\n     While self-discipline might be inferred, the passage is more focused on the daily routines and habits rather than directly proving the dependence of success on self-discipline.\n\n4. **Conclude based on the analysis**:\n   The option that best matches the author's stated aim is Option (C): \"try to understand why great people lived the way they did.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) try to understand why great people lived the way they did.**",

By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives – when they slept and ate and worked and worried – I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,’ the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote. I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.’\nIn that sense, this is a superficial book. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. (The novelist John Cheever thought that you couldn’t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self – isn’t that the truth?) My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me? \nI don’t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages – probably some of them can’t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises – but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \nThe book’s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people’s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot. But in the right hands, your daily routine can be a finely calibrated mechanism for taking advantage of a range of limited resources: time (the most limited resource of all) as well as willpower and optimism. A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. The psychologist William James thought you wanted to put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a chronic procrastinator and could never stick to a regular schedule. \nAs it happens, it was an inspired bout of procrastination that led to the creation of this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I’m a classic ‘morning person’, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers’ working schedules. These were easy to find and highly entertaining. It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place – hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people’s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I’ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. In other cases, I have cobbled together a summary of their routines from secondary sources. I should note here that this book would have been impossible without the research of the hundreds of biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I drew upon. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C2\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) was correct to focus on seemingly trivial details.",

The writer then goes on to talk about personal struggles related to creativity and productivity, such as balancing creative work with earning a living, managing time effectively, and dealing with moods.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option:**\n\n   - **(A) counters a potential criticism of the book:** The passage does not discuss any criticisms of the book. Instead, it focuses on the personal aspects and challenges the author faces, so this is not correct.\n   \n   - **(B) explains the problem he faced when writing the book:** While the author does mention personal problems related to writing and productivity, the primary focus is on his reflections and insights rather than a direct explanation of the problems he faced.\n   \n   - **(C) justifies the way the book has been organised:** There is no discussion in the second paragraph about the organization of the book. The focus is more on the personal relevance and challenges of the topics covered.\n   \n   - **(D) explains the value of the book for writers:** The passage discusses the value of the book for writers by providing examples of how brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. The author uses the book to offer practical advice and insights into daily routines and productivity, which directly relates to the value for writers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**(D) explains the value of the book for writers.**",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "In the second paragraph, the writer explains the value of the book for writers. The paragraph begins with a reflection on the superficial nature of the book, but then the writer goes on to explain that the book is also personal and deals with issues that the writer struggles with in their own life. The writer then explains that the book provides examples of how successful people have dealt with similar challenges, and that the book is about routines and how they can be used to make the most of limited resources. The writer also explains that the book is based on research and that the book would not have been possible without the work of other researchers. Overall, the writer explains the value of the book for writers by showing how it can help them deal with challenges and improve their routines. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) explains the value of the book for writers."

By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives – when they slept and ate and worked and worried – I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,’ the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote. I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.’\nIn that sense, this is a superficial book. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. (The novelist John Cheever thought that you couldn’t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self – isn’t that the truth?) My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me? \nI don’t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages – probably some of them can’t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises – but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \nThe book’s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people’s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot. But in the right hands, your daily routine can be a finely calibrated mechanism for taking advantage of a range of limited resources: time (the most limited resource of all) as well as willpower and optimism. A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. The psychologist William James thought you wanted to put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a chronic procrastinator and could never stick to a regular schedule. \nAs it happens, it was an inspired bout of procrastination that led to the creation of this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I’m a classic ‘morning person’, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers’ working schedules. These were easy to find and highly entertaining. It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place – hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people’s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I’ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. In other cases, I have cobbled together a summary of their routines from secondary sources. I should note here that this book would have been impossible without the research of the hundreds of biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I drew upon.

By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives – when they slept and ate and worked and worried – I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,’ the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote.

My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me? \nI don’t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages – probably some of them can’t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises – but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \nThe book’s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people’s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot.

One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I’m a classic ‘morning person’, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers’ working schedules.

It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place – hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people’s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I’ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews.

What’s remarkable, West says, is just ‘how little this has affected the quality of our thinking.’\nAccording to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading, for one thing, has declined 10 percentage points, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Many, including Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles, believe that a greater focus on visual media comes at a price. ‘A drop-off in reading has possibly contributed to a decline in critical thinking,’ she says. ‘There is a greater emphasis on real-time media and multi-tasking rather than focusing on a single thing.’ Nevertheless, a definitive answer about how technology affects critical thinking is not yet available. Instead, due to the ever greater presence of technology, critical thinking has landed in a mushy swamp, and academics can no longer rely on fundamental beliefs that they previously held.\nWhile it’s tempting to view computers, video games, and the internet in a largely good or bad way, the reality is that they may be both, and different technologies, systems, and uses yield entirely different results. For example, a computer game may promote critical thinking or detract from it. Reading on the internet may ratchet up one’s ability to analyze while chasing an endless array of hyperlinks may undercut deeper thought.\nExposure to technology fundamentally changes the way people think, says Greenfield, who recently analyzed more than 50 studies on learning and technology. As visual media have exploded, noticeable changes have resulted, she notes. ‘Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not,’ Greenfield explains. ‘It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary.’ However, she has found that visual media actually improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, ‘most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination,’ she says. The upshot? Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities.\nHow society views technology has a great deal to do with how it forms perceptions about critical thinking. And nowhere is the conflict more apparent than at the intersection of video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, points out that things aren’t always as they appear. ‘There is a strong undercurrent of opinion that video and computer games aren’t healthy for kids,’ he says. ‘The reality is that they are not only a major form of entertainment, they often provide a very good tool for learning.’ In fact, an expanding body of evidence indicates that joysticks can go a long way toward building smarter children with better reasoning skills. Games such as Sim City and Civilization extend beyond rote memorization, and teach decision-making and analytical skills in immersive, virtual environments that resemble the real world, Gee says. Moreover, these games – and some virtual worlds – give participants freedom to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.\nIt’s certain that in the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it’s time to take a closer look at technology and understand the subtleties of how it affects thinking and analysis.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) does not enable us to make better judgements.",

Therefore, it could imply that remembering details might be improved as a result of enhanced information handling.\n\n- **Option D:** \"does not allow us to find solutions to problems faster.\"\n  - The passage states that information technology \"makes it more difficult to really think\" when dealing with complex problems. This implies that it might slow down problem-solving processes, thus not allowing us to find solutions faster.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nOption D aligns best with the passage's implication that information technology makes it harder to think critically, which would logically lead to slower problem-solving processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**(D) does not allow us to find solutions to problems faster.**",

What’s remarkable, West says, is just ‘how little this has affected the quality of our thinking.’\nAccording to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading, for one thing, has declined 10 percentage points, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Many, including Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles, believe that a greater focus on visual media comes at a price. ‘A drop-off in reading has possibly contributed to a decline in critical thinking,’ she says. ‘There is a greater emphasis on real-time media and multi-tasking rather than focusing on a single thing.’ Nevertheless, a definitive answer about how technology affects critical thinking is not yet available. Instead, due to the ever greater presence of technology, critical thinking has landed in a mushy swamp, and academics can no longer rely on fundamental beliefs that they previously held.\nWhile it’s tempting to view computers, video games, and the internet in a largely good or bad way, the reality is that they may be both, and different technologies, systems, and uses yield entirely different results. For example, a computer game may promote critical thinking or detract from it. Reading on the internet may ratchet up one’s ability to analyze while chasing an endless array of hyperlinks may undercut deeper thought.\nExposure to technology fundamentally changes the way people think, says Greenfield, who recently analyzed more than 50 studies on learning and technology. As visual media have exploded, noticeable changes have resulted, she notes. ‘Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not,’ Greenfield explains. ‘It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary.’ However, she has found that visual media actually improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, ‘most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination,’ she says. The upshot? Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities.\nHow society views technology has a great deal to do with how it forms perceptions about critical thinking. And nowhere is the conflict more apparent than at the intersection of video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, points out that things aren’t always as they appear. ‘There is a strong undercurrent of opinion that video and computer games aren’t healthy for kids,’ he says. ‘The reality is that they are not only a major form of entertainment, they often provide a very good tool for learning.’ In fact, an expanding body of evidence indicates that joysticks can go a long way toward building smarter children with better reasoning skills.

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the passage and the reference text step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Reference Passage\n\nThe reference passage focuses on the impact of technology on critical thinking. It discusses the increasing exposure to technology and its effects on various aspects of cognitive functions, including critical thinking.\n\n- **Critical Thinking**: The passage mentions that technology can enhance or detract from critical thinking depending on how it is used.\n- **Declining Literary Reading**: It references a decline in literary reading, which correlates with a decline in critical thinking according to Patricia Greenfield.\n- **Technological Influence on Thinking**: The passage acknowledges that technology fundamentally changes the way people think, but does not specify how.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Question Context\n\nThe question asks about Patricia Greenfield's stance based on her research into learning and technology. The options provided suggest that Greenfield believes visual media have a particular effect.\n\n### Step 3: Extracting Relevant Information from the Passage\n\nIn the passage, it states:\n\n\"Greenfield, a professor of psychology and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles, believes that a greater focus on visual media comes at a price. 'A drop-off in reading has possibly contributed to a decline in critical thinking,' she says.\"\n\nThis sentence directly aligns with the question. It suggests that Greenfield believes a greater focus on visual media (like video games, TV, etc.) contributes to a decline in critical thinking.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Options\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n- **(A) might actually develop people’s creativity in new ways.**\n  - This is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of creativity being developed by visual media.\n\n- **(B) have contributed significantly to linguistic change.**\n  - While the passage mentions declining literary reading, it does not claim significant contribution to linguistic change.\n\n- **(C) may prevent certain users from fulfilling their potential.**\n  - This aligns closely with the statement about a decline in critical thinking and reading leading to a decline in overall cognitive functioning.\n\n- **(D) can detract from people’s ability to relate to each other.**\n  - The passage does not discuss the ability to relate to others as being impacted by visual media.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the reference passage, Patricia Greenfield believes that a greater focus on visual media may prevent certain users from fulfilling their potential, specifically by contributing to a decline in critical thinking.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: **(C) may prevent certain users from fulfilling their potential.**",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "Based on the passage, the correct answer is (C) may prevent certain users from fulfilling their potential.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the impact of technology and visual media on critical thinking and learning.\n2. Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology, is mentioned as having analyzed over 50 studies on learning and technology.\n3. Greenfield notes that while visual media can improve some types of information processing, they often do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination.\n4. The passage states that \"most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination,\" and this can lead to underachievement among many people, particularly younger ones.\n5. Greenfield's research suggests that the use of visual media may prevent certain users from fully developing their potential, as it does not engage the imagination, reflection, or critical thinking in the same way that reading does.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the most accurate reflection of Greenfield's beliefs as presented in the passage."

        "processed_text": "In the sixth paragraph, the writer reports the view that, for young people, playing video games  \nOptions:\n(A) is a means of escape from the pressures of everyday life.\n(B) is a highly suitable medium for intellectual development.\n(C) teaches effective ways of solving conflict.\n(D) allows enjoyment of a safe form of entertainment.\nReference Passage: Critical, or analytical, thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in attempt to have a deeper understanding. ‘There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth,’ observes Adrian West, research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., and a former computer science lecturer at the University of Manchester. \nAlthough there’s little debate that information technology complements – and often enhances – the human mind in the quest to store information and process an ever-growing tangle of bits and bytes, there’s increasing concern that the same technology is changing the way we approach complex problems, and making it more difficult to really think. ‘We’re exposed to greater amounts of poor yet charismatic thinking, the fads of intellectual fashion, opinion, and mere assertion,’ says West. ‘The wealth of communications and information can easily overwhelm our reasoning abilities.’ What’s more, it’s ironic that ever-growing piles of data and information do not equate to greater knowledge and better decision-making. What’s remarkable, West says, is just ‘how little this has affected the quality of our thinking.’\nAccording to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading, for one thing, has declined 10 percentage points, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Many, including Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles, believe that a greater focus on visual media comes at a price. ‘A drop-off in reading has possibly contributed to a decline in critical thinking,’ she says. ‘There is a greater emphasis on real-time media and multi-tasking rather than focusing on a single thing.’ Nevertheless, a definitive answer about how technology affects critical thinking is not yet available. Instead, due to the ever greater presence of technology, critical thinking has landed in a mushy swamp, and academics can no longer rely on fundamental beliefs that they previously held.\nWhile it’s tempting to view computers, video games, and the internet in a largely good or bad way, the reality is that they may be both, and different technologies, systems, and uses yield entirely different results. For example, a computer game may promote critical thinking or detract from it. Reading on the internet may ratchet up one’s ability to analyze while chasing an endless array of hyperlinks may undercut deeper thought.\nExposure to technology fundamentally changes the way people think, says Greenfield, who recently analyzed more than 50 studies on learning and technology. As visual media have exploded, noticeable changes have resulted, she notes. ‘Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not,’ Greenfield explains. ‘It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary.’ However, she has found that visual media actually improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, ‘most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination,’ she says. The upshot? Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities.\nHow society views technology has a great deal to do with how it forms perceptions about critical thinking. And nowhere is the conflict more apparent than at the intersection of video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, points out that things aren’t always as they appear. ‘There is a strong undercurrent of opinion that video and computer games aren’t healthy for kids,’ he says. ‘The reality is that they are not only a major form of entertainment, they often provide a very good tool for learning.’ In fact, an expanding body of evidence indicates that joysticks can go a long way toward building smarter children with better reasoning skills. Games such as Sim City and Civilization extend beyond rote memorization, and teach decision-making and analytical skills in immersive, virtual environments that resemble the real world, Gee says. Moreover, these games – and some virtual worlds – give participants freedom to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.\nIt’s certain that in the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it’s time to take a closer look at technology and understand the subtleties of how it affects thinking and analysis.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) is a highly suitable medium for intellectual development.",

        "processed_text": "What do we learn about Matthew Crawford in the first paragraph?\nOptions:\n(A) His success as a writer conflicts with his desire for solitude.\n(B) He writes as a diversion from repetitive work.\n(C) His writing is rooted in his own experiences.\n(D) He can struggle to focus on his writing work.\nReference Passage: When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic, a job he turned to after becoming disillusioned with office life and his work for social policy institutions. His first book was a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. His most recent one is a kind of philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was out shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine during a delay of just a few seconds while he entered his pin number. \nCrawford says he realised that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. What we want to be at the forefront of our mind at any particular moment is a very personal matter, and we are being prevented from deciding this for ourselves by something which we are, in the main, unaware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think, or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers. ‘We increasingly encounter the world through these representations that are addressed to us, often with manipulative intent: video games, apps on your phone,’ says Crawford. They reflect all our desires perfectly, and end up taking over. \nCrawford is not the only one who is worried. Everyone knows that office worker who complains about emails all day and then spends their free time doing email. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table – a familiar phenomenon to those of us who have sat bored at dinner, feeling the gravitational draw of the black square in our pocket. There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837. But it’s indisputable that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. A world of constant choice means that our powers of self-control are heavily taxed, and this has a social impact. \nWe’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation. By only engaging with representations of people rather than people themselves, Crawford argues, we risk losing something fundamental in our society. And screens are only part of the problem. He gives his gym as an example. There used to be a single music player in the middle of the room, available to everyone. People didn’t all like the same music and that could lead to tension. Now people tend to listen to their own music on ear buds. ‘The gym used to be a social place and it has lost that character. Genuine connection to other people tends to happen in the context of conflict – having a contest of different people’s tastes and working it out,’ he says. \nCrawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player and a motorbike racer as people whose roles force them to deal with material reality. No representation can replicate the feel of the hockey puck on ice, or gravel under your tyres at high speed. Each relies on their good judgment of a complicated subject and the ability to manage the presence of others in the same space.\n‘When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as pale substitutes for the kind of involvement you have with real things,’ he says. ‘They lose some of their grip.’ This is not to suggest that everyone should rush out to chef school; more that it is important to find a way to use your judgment. There are plenty of benefits in addition to professional satisfaction. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes you less able to focus on what matters. The practice of paying attention to one thing, by contrast, makes it easier to pay attention to others.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) His writing is rooted in his own experiences.",

His first book was a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. His most recent one is a kind of philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was out shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine during a delay of just a few seconds while he entered his pin number. \nCrawford says he realised that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. What we want to be at the forefront of our mind at any particular moment is a very personal matter, and we are being prevented from deciding this for ourselves by something which we are, in the main, unaware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think, or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers. ‘We increasingly encounter the world through these representations that are addressed to us, often with manipulative intent: video games, apps on your phone,’ says Crawford. They reflect all our desires perfectly, and end up taking over. \nCrawford is not the only one who is worried. Everyone knows that office worker who complains about emails all day and then spends their free time doing email. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table – a familiar phenomenon to those of us who have sat bored at dinner, feeling the gravitational draw of the black square in our pocket. There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837. But it’s indisputable that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. A world of constant choice means that our powers of self-control are heavily taxed, and this has a social impact. \nWe’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation. By only engaging with representations of people rather than people themselves, Crawford argues, we risk losing something fundamental in our society. And screens are only part of the problem. He gives his gym as an example. There used to be a single music player in the middle of the room, available to everyone. People didn’t all like the same music and that could lead to tension. Now people tend to listen to their own music on ear buds. ‘The gym used to be a social place and it has lost that character. Genuine connection to other people tends to happen in the context of conflict – having a contest of different people’s tastes and working it out,’ he says. \nCrawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player and a motorbike racer as people whose roles force them to deal with material reality. No representation can replicate the feel of the hockey puck on ice, or gravel under your tyres at high speed. Each relies on their good judgment of a complicated subject and the ability to manage the presence of others in the same space.\n‘When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as pale substitutes for the kind of involvement you have with real things,’ he says. ‘They lose some of their grip.’ This is not to suggest that everyone should rush out to chef school; more that it is important to find a way to use your judgment. There are plenty of benefits in addition to professional satisfaction. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes you less able to focus on what matters.

This leads to a loss of fundamental social interactions and a reliance on representations of people rather than real human connections.\n\n**Option (D): There is a lack of awareness of the impact of technology on social life.**\n- This option is not entirely accurate because the passage does indicate that people are aware of the issue, as evidenced by the example of the office worker who complains about emails.\n\n**Option (B): People’s tendency to focus too much on themselves is being facilitated.**\n- This option is partially correct but does not fully capture the concern about the loss of genuine social connections.\n\n**Option (C): It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between work and leisure.**\n- This option is not directly addressed in the third paragraph.\n\n**Option (A): Too little research has been conducted into people’s ability to concentrate.**\n- This option is not mentioned in the third paragraph.\n\n**Best Match:**\nThe best match for the concern expressed in the third paragraph is not perfectly captured by any of the given options. However, the closest option that aligns with the concern is:\n\n**(B) People’s tendency to focus too much on themselves is being facilitated.**\n\nWhile this option is not entirely accurate, it does reflect the concern about self-obsession and the impact on social connections. The passage emphasizes the loss of genuine social interactions and the preference for digital communication, which aligns with the idea of people focusing too much on themselves."

His first book was a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. His most recent one is a kind of philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was out shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine during a delay of just a few seconds while he entered his pin number. \nCrawford says he realised that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. What we want to be at the forefront of our mind at any particular moment is a very personal matter, and we are being prevented from deciding this for ourselves by something which we are, in the main, unaware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think, or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers. ‘We increasingly encounter the world through these representations that are addressed to us, often with manipulative intent: video games, apps on your phone,’ says Crawford. They reflect all our desires perfectly, and end up taking over. \nCrawford is not the only one who is worried. Everyone knows that office worker who complains about emails all day and then spends their free time doing email. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table – a familiar phenomenon to those of us who have sat bored at dinner, feeling the gravitational draw of the black square in our pocket. There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837. But it’s indisputable that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. A world of constant choice means that our powers of self-control are heavily taxed, and this has a social impact. \nWe’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation. By only engaging with representations of people rather than people themselves, Crawford argues, we risk losing something fundamental in our society. And screens are only part of the problem. He gives his gym as an example. There used to be a single music player in the middle of the room, available to everyone. People didn’t all like the same music and that could lead to tension. Now people tend to listen to their own music on ear buds. ‘The gym used to be a social place and it has lost that character. Genuine connection to other people tends to happen in the context of conflict – having a contest of different people’s tastes and working it out,’ he says. \nCrawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player and a motorbike racer as people whose roles force them to deal with material reality. No representation can replicate the feel of the hockey puck on ice, or gravel under your tyres at high speed. Each relies on their good judgment of a complicated subject and the ability to manage the presence of others in the same space.\n‘When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as pale substitutes for the kind of involvement you have with real things,’ he says. ‘They lose some of their grip.’ This is not to suggest that everyone should rush out to chef school; more that it is important to find a way to use your judgment. There are plenty of benefits in addition to professional satisfaction. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes you less able to focus on what matters.

More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player and a motorbike racer as people whose roles force them to deal with material reality. No representation can replicate the feel of the hockey puck on ice, or gravel under your tyres at high speed.

He highlights that activities requiring physical presence and interaction (like playing ice-hockey or riding a motorbike) require practical judgment and management of interpersonal dynamics.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n(A) **People increasingly have disagreements.** - This option does not directly relate to the content of the fourth paragraph.\n(B) **People are reluctant to make decisions.** - While the paragraph mentions the difficulty of making decisions due to distractions, this isn't specifically mentioned as a regret by Crawford.\n(C) **People’s instincts have changed over time.** - This option is also not discussed in the paragraph.\n(D) **People no longer need to negotiate.** - The paragraph doesn't mention that people no longer need to negotiate; instead, it suggests a shift towards mediated interactions.\n\nGiven the analysis, Crawford's regret in the fourth paragraph is not explicitly stated. However, the core sentiment aligns with the idea that people are relying too much on mediated experiences and are missing out on direct, meaningful interactions.\n\nConsidering the provided options and the context, the closest answer would be:\n\n**(A) people increasingly have disagreements.**\n\nThis is because the paragraph implies a preference for direct, physical interactions over mediated ones, which might lead to fewer opportunities for negotiation and understanding. However, this is not a direct statement of regret but rather a commentary on the shift Crawford perceives in society.\n\n**Final Answer: (A)**",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "In the fourth paragraph, Crawford regrets that:\n\n(C) people’s instincts have changed over time.\n\nThe passage describes how Crawford observes a shift in how people interact with the world, particularly in public spaces like gyms, where people used to engage with each other and their environment more directly. He notes that people now prefer to listen to their own music on earbuds, leading to a loss of genuine connection and social interaction. This change in behavior reflects a broader shift in people's instincts and how they engage with the world, which Crawford regrets."

There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837. But it’s indisputable that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. A world of constant choice means that our powers of self-control are heavily taxed, and this has a social impact. \nWe’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation. By only engaging with representations of people rather than people themselves, Crawford argues, we risk losing something fundamental in our society. And screens are only part of the problem. He gives his gym as an example. There used to be a single music player in the middle of the room, available to everyone. People didn’t all like the same music and that could lead to tension. Now people tend to listen to their own music on ear buds. ‘The gym used to be a social place and it has lost that character. Genuine connection to other people tends to happen in the context of conflict – having a contest of different people’s tastes and working it out,’ he says. \nCrawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player and a motorbike racer as people whose roles force them to deal with material reality. No representation can replicate the feel of the hockey puck on ice, or gravel under your tyres at high speed. Each relies on their good judgment of a complicated subject and the ability to manage the presence of others in the same space.\n‘When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as pale substitutes for the kind of involvement you have with real things,’ he says. ‘They lose some of their grip.’ This is not to suggest that everyone should rush out to chef school; more that it is important to find a way to use your judgment. There are plenty of benefits in addition to professional satisfaction. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes you less able to focus on what matters. The practice of paying attention to one thing, by contrast, makes it easier to pay attention to others.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) expanding on the merits of his approach.",

His first book was a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. His most recent one is a kind of philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was out shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine during a delay of just a few seconds while he entered his pin number. \nCrawford says he realised that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. What we want to be at the forefront of our mind at any particular moment is a very personal matter, and we are being prevented from deciding this for ourselves by something which we are, in the main, unaware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think, or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers. ‘We increasingly encounter the world through these representations that are addressed to us, often with manipulative intent: video games, apps on your phone,’ says Crawford. They reflect all our desires perfectly, and end up taking over. \nCrawford is not the only one who is worried. Everyone knows that office worker who complains about emails all day and then spends their free time doing email. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table – a familiar phenomenon to those of us who have sat bored at dinner, feeling the gravitational draw of the black square in our pocket. There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837.

        "processed_text": "How does the writer feel when he is asked about his job?\nOptions:\n(A) annoyed that people do not understand what he says\n(B) frustrated that people define themselves by their work\n(C) apprehensive about the reaction his response will cause\n(D) anxious to explain that he is no cleverer than anyone else\nReference Passage: ‘What do you do for a living?’ It’s classic small talk – we define ourselves by our jobs. And it’s a question usually answered in a few words. However, when you’re a philosopher, as I am, it’s slightly harder to deal with. For one thing, describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows. This is clearly nonsense; philosophers are no different from – indeed are part of – the masses, but the persistence of the notion makes me hesitate.\nSo why does this stereotype of a philosopher pervade? One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, was the most virtuous of all. Few modern philosophers would agree, but there’s still a cultural aura around philosophy that associates it, rightly, with the life of the mind. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, remarked that ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’, meaning that a life that simply accepted prevailing cultural norms would be deeply unsatisfying. It’s partly mankind’s innate ability to reflect upon the world that allows us control over our lives, and therefore the ability to make our own decisions. \nBut the examined life doesn’t require the wide reading of the philosophical classics, nor a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define our lives to ensure they deserve their central role. It doesn’t need to be the life of the sage, removed from society in order to evaluate it impartially. In fact, in order for the examined life to serve in guiding the experience of individuals, it’s actually a deeply practical enterprise, and one in which knowledge should be shared, as it’s an essential element of the good life.\nThis brings me to a second reason for the misconception about philosophers: in becoming a profession, academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences, especially those of people without formal training in the discipline. This isn’t entirely the fault of philosophers: university funding, performance evaluations and esteem are tied to increasingly expensive and inaccessible academic journals. As a result, philosophers have little opportunity to explain their ideas to anyone other than the minute group of experts who populate their particular field of study. For the lay observer, the discipline can often seem far removed from reality.\nIf the bulk of philosophers once challenged this view of themselves as being remote, many have since ceased. Although the university system initiated the environment of privileged isolation, academics haven’t shied away from supporting it. As thinking in some areas has grown increasingly concerned with very specific, technical debates, the process of interpreting them for philosophers working outside the specific subfield can be laborious enough, but trying to do so for the untrained mind becomes almost impossible. Philosophy, in some circles, has withdrawn from society altogether. This trend must be reversed. \nI sometimes describe myself as an ‘ethicist’, because most of my work is in ethics, the field of philosophy concerned with evaluating human activity. More recently, though, I’ve begun to feel that title insufficient to capture my area of inquiry, because ethics is commonly asserted as being connected to formal codes, values and laws. This represents quite a new and largely unconsidered development in philosophical thinking: the field of ethics has colloquially come to refer to applied ethics – a subfield that explores the justice of particular social practices. The task of the ethicist, in modern thinking, is to determine whether or not a certain activity is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. \nThese are important questions, and ones I engage in regularly. However, there’s more to philosophy than this. A typical discussion might, for example, begin by exploring whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) before moving to an exploration of how we think about responsibility, our attitudes towards art, and the influence of market consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) apprehensive about the reaction his response will cause",

He mentions that philosophers are frequently asked \"What do you do for a living?\" and that describing oneself as a philosopher can sound pretentious.\n\nStep 3: Look for clues about the writer's feelings\nThe writer expresses hesitation and discomfort when answering this question. He states that philosophers are often seen as having a special connection to truth or enlightenment, which he considers nonsensical. Additionally, he notes that while philosophers are supposed to judge the activities of others, they also claim to live a life of contemplation, suggesting a sense of privilege or special status.\n\nStep 4: Compare the writer's feelings to the given options\nLet's examine each option:\n\n(A) annoyed that people do not understand what he says - The writer seems more concerned with the perception of philosophy and the implications of being called a philosopher rather than annoyed by misunderstandings.\n(B) frustrated that people define themselves by their work - While the writer does express discomfort with the notion of philosophers defining themselves by their work, the primary feeling expressed is more related to the perception and implications of being a philosopher rather than frustration with self-definition.\n(C) apprehensive about the reaction his response will cause - The writer does mention hesitating and feeling uncomfortable, indicating a sense of apprehension.\n(D) anxious to explain that he is no cleverer than anyone else - There's no indication that the writer is anxious to clarify his intelligence level.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis\nOption (C) \"apprehensive about the reaction his response will cause\" best captures the writer's feelings as described in the passage. He is cautious about how people perceive philosophers and the implications of being called a philosopher.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) apprehensive about the reaction his response will cause.",

The writer is a philosopher, and he acknowledges that describing himself as a philosopher can sound pretentious to many people.\n2. He explains that philosophers are often stereotyped as people who judge others' activities and celebrate intellectual life, which can make people hesitate to ask about his job.\n3. The writer also mentions that academic philosophy has become increasingly removed from lived experiences, making it difficult for philosophers to explain their ideas to laypeople.\n4. He expresses concern that the field of ethics, which he works in, has come to be seen as only about formal codes, values, and laws, rather than a broader exploration of human activity and behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most fitting option is:\n\n(C) apprehensive about the reaction his response will cause\n\nThe writer is concerned about how people might react to his job description, given the stereotypes and misconceptions about philosophers and the field of ethics. He is apprehensive about the potential misunderstanding or lack of appreciation for the broader scope of his work."

And it’s a question usually answered in a few words. However, when you’re a philosopher, as I am, it’s slightly harder to deal with. For one thing, describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows. This is clearly nonsense; philosophers are no different from – indeed are part of – the masses, but the persistence of the notion makes me hesitate.\nSo why does this stereotype of a philosopher pervade? One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, was the most virtuous of all. Few modern philosophers would agree, but there’s still a cultural aura around philosophy that associates it, rightly, with the life of the mind. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, remarked that ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’, meaning that a life that simply accepted prevailing cultural norms would be deeply unsatisfying. It’s partly mankind’s innate ability to reflect upon the world that allows us control over our lives, and therefore the ability to make our own decisions. \nBut the examined life doesn’t require the wide reading of the philosophical classics, nor a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define our lives to ensure they deserve their central role. It doesn’t need to be the life of the sage, removed from society in order to evaluate it impartially. In fact, in order for the examined life to serve in guiding the experience of individuals, it’s actually a deeply practical enterprise, and one in which knowledge should be shared, as it’s an essential element of the good life.\nThis brings me to a second reason for the misconception about philosophers: in becoming a profession, academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences, especially those of people without formal training in the discipline. This isn’t entirely the fault of philosophers: university funding, performance evaluations and esteem are tied to increasingly expensive and inaccessible academic journals. As a result, philosophers have little opportunity to explain their ideas to anyone other than the minute group of experts who populate their particular field of study. For the lay observer, the discipline can often seem far removed from reality.\nIf the bulk of philosophers once challenged this view of themselves as being remote, many have since ceased. Although the university system initiated the environment of privileged isolation, academics haven’t shied away from supporting it. As thinking in some areas has grown increasingly concerned with very specific, technical debates, the process of interpreting them for philosophers working outside the specific subfield can be laborious enough, but trying to do so for the untrained mind becomes almost impossible. Philosophy, in some circles, has withdrawn from society altogether. This trend must be reversed. \nI sometimes describe myself as an ‘ethicist’, because most of my work is in ethics, the field of philosophy concerned with evaluating human activity. More recently, though, I’ve begun to feel that title insufficient to capture my area of inquiry, because ethics is commonly asserted as being connected to formal codes, values and laws. This represents quite a new and largely unconsidered development in philosophical thinking: the field of ethics has colloquially come to refer to applied ethics – a subfield that explores the justice of particular social practices. The task of the ethicist, in modern thinking, is to determine whether or not a certain activity is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. \nThese are important questions, and ones I engage in regularly. However, there’s more to philosophy than this. A typical discussion might, for example, begin by exploring whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) before moving to an exploration of how we think about responsibility, our attitudes towards art, and the influence of market consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) We are all capable of a certain degree of contemplation.",

And it’s a question usually answered in a few words. However, when you’re a philosopher, as I am, it’s slightly harder to deal with. For one thing, describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows. This is clearly nonsense; philosophers are no different from – indeed are part of – the masses, but the persistence of the notion makes me hesitate.\nSo why does this stereotype of a philosopher pervade? One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, was the most virtuous of all. Few modern philosophers would agree, but there’s still a cultural aura around philosophy that associates it, rightly, with the life of the mind. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, remarked that ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’, meaning that a life that simply accepted prevailing cultural norms would be deeply unsatisfying. It’s partly mankind’s innate ability to reflect upon the world that allows us control over our lives, and therefore the ability to make our own decisions. \nBut the examined life doesn’t require the wide reading of the philosophical classics, nor a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define our lives to ensure they deserve their central role. It doesn’t need to be the life of the sage, removed from society in order to evaluate it impartially. In fact, in order for the examined life to serve in guiding the experience of individuals, it’s actually a deeply practical enterprise, and one in which knowledge should be shared, as it’s an essential element of the good life.\nThis brings me to a second reason for the misconception about philosophers: in becoming a profession, academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences, especially those of people without formal training in the discipline. This isn’t entirely the fault of philosophers: university funding, performance evaluations and esteem are tied to increasingly expensive and inaccessible academic journals. As a result, philosophers have little opportunity to explain their ideas to anyone other than the minute group of experts who populate their particular field of study. For the lay observer, the discipline can often seem far removed from reality.\nIf the bulk of philosophers once challenged this view of themselves as being remote, many have since ceased. Although the university system initiated the environment of privileged isolation, academics haven’t shied away from supporting it. As thinking in some areas has grown increasingly concerned with very specific, technical debates, the process of interpreting them for philosophers working outside the specific subfield can be laborious enough, but trying to do so for the untrained mind becomes almost impossible. Philosophy, in some circles, has withdrawn from society altogether. This trend must be reversed. \nI sometimes describe myself as an ‘ethicist’, because most of my work is in ethics, the field of philosophy concerned with evaluating human activity. More recently, though, I’ve begun to feel that title insufficient to capture my area of inquiry, because ethics is commonly asserted as being connected to formal codes, values and laws. This represents quite a new and largely unconsidered development in philosophical thinking: the field of ethics has colloquially come to refer to applied ethics – a subfield that explores the justice of particular social practices. The task of the ethicist, in modern thinking, is to determine whether or not a certain activity is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. \nThese are important questions, and ones I engage in regularly. However, there’s more to philosophy than this. A typical discussion might, for example, begin by exploring whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) before moving to an exploration of how we think about responsibility, our attitudes towards art, and the influence of market consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) few people ever find out about philosophical studies.",

And it’s a question usually answered in a few words. However, when you’re a philosopher, as I am, it’s slightly harder to deal with. For one thing, describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows. This is clearly nonsense; philosophers are no different from – indeed are part of – the masses, but the persistence of the notion makes me hesitate.\nSo why does this stereotype of a philosopher pervade? One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, was the most virtuous of all. Few modern philosophers would agree, but there’s still a cultural aura around philosophy that associates it, rightly, with the life of the mind. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, remarked that ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’, meaning that a life that simply accepted prevailing cultural norms would be deeply unsatisfying. It’s partly mankind’s innate ability to reflect upon the world that allows us control over our lives, and therefore the ability to make our own decisions. \nBut the examined life doesn’t require the wide reading of the philosophical classics, nor a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define our lives to ensure they deserve their central role. It doesn’t need to be the life of the sage, removed from society in order to evaluate it impartially. In fact, in order for the examined life to serve in guiding the experience of individuals, it’s actually a deeply practical enterprise, and one in which knowledge should be shared, as it’s an essential element of the good life.\nThis brings me to a second reason for the misconception about philosophers: in becoming a profession, academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences, especially those of people without formal training in the discipline. This isn’t entirely the fault of philosophers: university funding, performance evaluations and esteem are tied to increasingly expensive and inaccessible academic journals. As a result, philosophers have little opportunity to explain their ideas to anyone other than the minute group of experts who populate their particular field of study. For the lay observer, the discipline can often seem far removed from reality.\nIf the bulk of philosophers once challenged this view of themselves as being remote, many have since ceased. Although the university system initiated the environment of privileged isolation, academics haven’t shied away from supporting it. As thinking in some areas has grown increasingly concerned with very specific, technical debates, the process of interpreting them for philosophers working outside the specific subfield can be laborious enough, but trying to do so for the untrained mind becomes almost impossible. Philosophy, in some circles, has withdrawn from society altogether. This trend must be reversed. \nI sometimes describe myself as an ‘ethicist’, because most of my work is in ethics, the field of philosophy concerned with evaluating human activity. More recently, though, I’ve begun to feel that title insufficient to capture my area of inquiry, because ethics is commonly asserted as being connected to formal codes, values and laws. This represents quite a new and largely unconsidered development in philosophical thinking: the field of ethics has colloquially come to refer to applied ethics – a subfield that explores the justice of particular social practices. The task of the ethicist, in modern thinking, is to determine whether or not a certain activity is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. \nThese are important questions, and ones I engage in regularly. However, there’s more to philosophy than this. A typical discussion might, for example, begin by exploring whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) before moving to an exploration of how we think about responsibility, our attitudes towards art, and the influence of market consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) It is too narrow to describe the work he does.",

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "The writer uses the example of downloading films to show (B) how applied ethics can lead to considerations of more universal issues.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. The writer discusses the field of ethics, particularly applied ethics, which explores the justice of specific social practices.\n2. The writer then provides an example of a typical discussion in applied ethics, starting with whether illegally downloading films is unethical.\n3. The writer explains that this initial question about the ethics of downloading films can lead to broader discussions about responsibility, attitudes towards art, and the influence of market consumerism.\n4. The writer concludes that by examining these ideas, people can gain a deeper understanding of the practices and behaviors that define their lives, which can lead to more universal considerations.\n\nTherefore, the example of downloading films is used to illustrate how applied ethics can lead to broader, more universal issues."

Historically however, philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to gaining insight into other philosophical issues. So when philosophers have talked of eating, it has actually served as a metaphor for some other topic, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that do appear superficially to be about food. However, further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. \nIt is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but did so across a range of human activities. Nonetheless, the name of Epicurus has grown synonymous with a passion for eating and drinking; in addition to casual speech, we see it invoked in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites, among others. Presumably these commercial interests expect some return if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers. \nWhatever else food is, it is inherently social and cultural. The food that we eat does not appear from nowhere, but rather derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\nOnce food has been prepared, critics will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected since, philosophically, the perception mechanisms underlying taste have not received much attention. Nearly all of the literature on perception has focussed on vision and this should be remedied. \nAnother aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit. \nThere are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. Most generally, we can ask what should we eat: organic; free-range; locally grown; vegetarian; foods that are not genetically modified? Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food. \nA separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ.

The passage argues that food philosophy is neglected but deserves more attention.\n* **(B) philosophical debate has seldom related directly to food.** This is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to other topics, but it also points out that food has been used as a metaphor for other philosophical ideas.\n* **(C) food may be enjoyed without understanding food philosophy.** This is partially true. The passage doesn't argue that understanding food philosophy is necessary to enjoy food. However, it suggests that food philosophy can offer deeper insights into our relationship with food.\n* **(D) food has attracted more philosophical debate than food lovers realise.** This is incorrect. The passage suggests that food philosophy is neglected, not that it's been widely debated.\n\n**Therefore, the best answer is (A).** \n\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nThe passage emphasizes the importance of food philosophy, highlighting its potential to provide deeper insights into our relationship with food, its social and cultural significance, and its ethical implications. \n",

It focuses on the commercial use of philosophical ideas related to food.\n\n#### Option (B): Some early philosophers had ideas about food that were ahead of their time.\n- While the passage mentions that some philosophers talked about food, it does not suggest that these ideas were particularly advanced or ahead of their time.\n\n#### Option (C): Popular fascination with food and cooking is a relatively modern phenomenon.\n- The passage does not address whether the fascination with food is modern or ancient.

However, it doesn't specifically highlight the diversity of geographical environments as a key point.\n   - **(B) Its role as a vital commodity in the economy of so many different countries**: While the passage touches on the social and cultural significance of food, it does not emphasize its economic role.\n   - **(C) The fact that food is so intricately connected to the processes of human life**: The paragraph discusses how food is inherently social, cultural, and involves ethical considerations. It also mentions that food is consumed more frequently and in more fundamental ways than other commodities, indicating its deep connection to human life.\n   - **(D) The fact that people have such a wide variety of ideas about food's importance**: Although the passage acknowledges that there are many ethical issues and different perspectives on food, it does not focus on the variety of ideas about food's importance as the main point.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the option that best captures what impresses the writer about food in the third paragraph is (C), as it highlights the intrinsic connection of food to the processes of human life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",

We need to look for a specific detail in the third paragraph that highlights this.\n\n**Analyzing the Third Paragraph:**\n\nThe third paragraph focuses on the following points about food:\n\n* **Food is inherently social and cultural:** It's not just about food itself, but the history, communities, and shared experiences associated with it.\n* **Food is interacted with more frequently than other commodities:** We eat it constantly, making it a central part of our lives.\n* **Food is a topic worthy of philosophical exploration:**  The writer argues that food's constant presence and impact on our lives make it a natural subject for philosophical inquiry.\n\n**Finding the Impressing Detail:**\n\nThe most impressive aspect of food mentioned in the third paragraph is its **inherent social and cultural nature**. The writer emphasizes how food is not just a physical substance but a product of history, shared experiences, and community. This connection to our social fabric makes food a fascinating and worthy subject for philosophical reflection.\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe answer is **(C) the fact that food is so intricately connected to the processes of human life.** \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's carefully read the reference passage and identify the key information related to the question.\n\n2. The passage discusses various aspects of food and how philosophers and food enthusiasts view them. It doesn't focus directly on the third paragraph, but provides context and background information.\n\n3. The question asks specifically about what impresses the writer in the third paragraph. However, the third paragraph is not provided in the reference text. Based on the options given and the overall context, we need to infer what might be discussed in the third paragraph.\n\n4. The third paragraph is implied to discuss something specific that impresses the writer about food. Let's look at each option and see if it aligns with the broader discussion:\n\n   - Option (A): \"its abundance in such a diverse range of geographical environments\" - This is mentioned in the passage, but it's not described as impressing the writer.\n   - Option (B): \"its role as a vital commodity in the economy of so many different countries\" - Again, this is mentioned, but it's not described as impressing the writer.\n   - Option (C): \"the fact that food is so intricately connected to the processes of human life\" - This is a significant point in the passage, and it emphasizes the importance and relevance of food in human life.\n   - Option (D): \"the fact that people have such a wide variety of ideas about food's importance\" - This is also mentioned, but it's presented more as a critique rather than something impressing the writer.\n\n5. Given the context and the emphasis on the importance and relevance of food in human life, option (C) seems most fitting.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the options given, the answer that best fits is:\n\n(C) the fact that food is so intricately connected to the processes of human life\n\nThis option aligns with the emphasis in the passage on how food is a fundamental part of human experience and societal interactions, which would likely impress a writer discussing food philosophy.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "In the third paragraph, the writer is impressed by the fact that food is so intricately connected to the processes of human life.

These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(C) the fact that food is so intricately connected to the processes of human life."

Historically however, philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to gaining insight into other philosophical issues. So when philosophers have talked of eating, it has actually served as a metaphor for some other topic, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that do appear superficially to be about food. However, further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. \nIt is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but did so across a range of human activities. Nonetheless, the name of Epicurus has grown synonymous with a passion for eating and drinking; in addition to casual speech, we see it invoked in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites, among others. Presumably these commercial interests expect some return if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers. \nWhatever else food is, it is inherently social and cultural. The food that we eat does not appear from nowhere, but rather derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\nOnce food has been prepared, critics will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected since, philosophically, the perception mechanisms underlying taste have not received much attention. Nearly all of the literature on perception has focussed on vision and this should be remedied. \nAnother aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit. \nThere are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. Most generally, we can ask what should we eat: organic; free-range; locally grown; vegetarian; foods that are not genetically modified? Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food. \nA separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks, it seems to me, have a special duty to their guests generated by the direct relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included as we come together to share food and companionship. Those who cook for a living, on the other hand, have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. This means that their kitchens are not open to all, but only those who are suitably qualified, and their relationships are those of colleagues, not friends. \nA recent essay titled ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ examines the ways in which food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. This takes place in two ways. First, we can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food. Second, we forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat – a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. But what is so unexpected is that the text is fleshed out by many wonderful examples and entertaining anecdotes, which brings to life for the general reader this aspect of food philosophy.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) philosophers should enquire further into the sense of taste.",

Thus, this option is not accurate.\n   \n   - **Option (D):** \"disappointed that the visual appeal of food is not more widely recognised.\"\n     - The passage does mention the visual appeal of food but does not express disappointment regarding its recognition. Instead, it discusses the challenges in considering food as an aesthetic object. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - After analyzing each option, none of them perfectly matches the writer's tone and stance as presented in the passage. However, the closest match is Option (D), which aligns most closely with the writer's discussion of the visual appeal of food without expressing disappointment.\n\nTherefore, the best answer based on the passage is:\n**(D) disappointed that the visual appeal of food is not more widely recognised.**",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Let's break down the passage to understand the writer's stance on the aesthetics of food.\n\n**The passage focuses on the following points:**\n\n* **Philosophical neglect of food:** The author argues that philosophical discussions of food have often been used as metaphors for other philosophical concepts, rather than being treated as a subject of their own.\n* **Food's social and cultural nature:** The author emphasizes that food is deeply intertwined with social and cultural contexts, highlighting its importance as a shared experience.\n* **The limited recognition of food's aesthetics:** The author criticizes the lack of philosophical attention given to the aesthetic qualities of food, comparing it to other art forms.\n* **The role of taste in food:** The author acknowledges that taste is a key aspect of food, but argues that it's not a special expertise like that of food critics.\n\n**Now, let's analyze the options:**\n\n* **(A) surprised that philosophers do not recognise that food inspires art.**  This is not the main point of the passage. The author is not surprised by this, but rather points out the lack of philosophical attention given to food's aesthetic qualities.\n* **(B) critical of those philosophers who rate art more highly than food.** This is a possible interpretation, but the passage doesn't explicitly criticize philosophers for this. It focuses on the lack of philosophical exploration of food's aesthetics.\n* **(C) dismissive of the suggestion that food is comparable to art forms.** This is a strong possibility. The author explicitly states that food is destroyed by the act of eating, unlike art which can persist.\n* **(D) disappointed that the visual appeal of food is not more widely recognised.** This is a possible interpretation, but the passage doesn't focus on the visual appeal of food. It focuses on the broader philosophical and cultural aspects of food.\n\n**The most accurate answer is (C).** The author is dismissive of the idea that food can be considered an aesthetic object in the same way as paintings or symphonies. They argue that food is consumed and then disappears, unlike art which can be preserved.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any other aspects of the passage! \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "Let's analyze the passage step-by-step to determine the correct answer:\n\n1. **Context Analysis**: The passage discusses various aspects of food, including its role in philosophy, its social and cultural significance, and the way it is perceived aesthetically.\n\n2. **Specific Paragraph Analysis**: The fifth paragraph specifically addresses the aesthetic appreciation of food. It mentions that while food is commonly enjoyed and appreciated, it is not typically considered a form of art due to the perishable nature of food.\n\n3. **Key Sentence Identification**: The key sentence in the fifth paragraph is \"Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit.\"\n\n4. **Option Analysis**:\n   - (A) \"surprised that philosophers do not recognize that food inspires art\" – There’s no indication of surprise here.\n   - (B) \"critical of those philosophers who rate art more highly than food\" – This option suggests criticism, but the paragraph does not express this sentiment.\n   - (C) \"dismissive of the suggestion that food is comparable to art forms\" – This aligns with the sentiment expressed in the paragraph. The author acknowledges that food is compared to art but argues against the notion that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit due to its perishability.\n   - (D) \"disappointed that the visual appeal of food is not more widely recognized\" – While there is a discussion about the lack of recognition, the disappointment is not explicitly stated.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The passage expresses that the comparison of food to art is made, but it dismisses the idea that food should be considered a proper object of aesthetic merit because of its perishability. Therefore, the most fitting description is:\n\n(C) dismissive of the suggestion that food is comparable to art forms.\n\nThis option best captures the tone and sentiment of the fifth paragraph.",

Historically however, philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to gaining insight into other philosophical issues. So when philosophers have talked of eating, it has actually served as a metaphor for some other topic, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that do appear superficially to be about food. However, further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. \nIt is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but did so across a range of human activities. Nonetheless, the name of Epicurus has grown synonymous with a passion for eating and drinking; in addition to casual speech, we see it invoked in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites, among others. Presumably these commercial interests expect some return if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers. \nWhatever else food is, it is inherently social and cultural. The food that we eat does not appear from nowhere, but rather derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\nOnce food has been prepared, critics will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected since, philosophically, the perception mechanisms underlying taste have not received much attention. Nearly all of the literature on perception has focussed on vision and this should be remedied. \nAnother aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit. \nThere are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. Most generally, we can ask what should we eat: organic; free-range; locally grown; vegetarian; foods that are not genetically modified? Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food. \nA separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks, it seems to me, have a special duty to their guests generated by the direct relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included as we come together to share food and companionship. Those who cook for a living, on the other hand, have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. This means that their kitchens are not open to all, but only those who are suitably qualified, and their relationships are those of colleagues, not friends. \nA recent essay titled ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ examines the ways in which food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. This takes place in two ways. First, we can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food. Second, we forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat – a practice with a long history in international diplomacy.

        "processed_text": "What does the writer find surprising about the essay ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’?\nOptions:\n(A) the biased views it reflects\n(B) the originality of the central thesis\n(C) the importance it places on food in political affairs\n(D) the nature of the supporting information\nReference Passage: Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who treasure food might expect that critical reflection on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. Historically however, philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to gaining insight into other philosophical issues. So when philosophers have talked of eating, it has actually served as a metaphor for some other topic, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that do appear superficially to be about food. However, further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. \nIt is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but did so across a range of human activities. Nonetheless, the name of Epicurus has grown synonymous with a passion for eating and drinking; in addition to casual speech, we see it invoked in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites, among others. Presumably these commercial interests expect some return if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers. \nWhatever else food is, it is inherently social and cultural. The food that we eat does not appear from nowhere, but rather derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\nOnce food has been prepared, critics will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected since, philosophically, the perception mechanisms underlying taste have not received much attention. Nearly all of the literature on perception has focussed on vision and this should be remedied. \nAnother aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit. \nThere are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. Most generally, we can ask what should we eat: organic; free-range; locally grown; vegetarian; foods that are not genetically modified? Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food. \nA separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks, it seems to me, have a special duty to their guests generated by the direct relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included as we come together to share food and companionship. Those who cook for a living, on the other hand, have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. This means that their kitchens are not open to all, but only those who are suitably qualified, and their relationships are those of colleagues, not friends. \nA recent essay titled ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ examines the ways in which food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. This takes place in two ways. First, we can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food. Second, we forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat – a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. But what is so unexpected is that the text is fleshed out by many wonderful examples and entertaining anecdotes, which brings to life for the general reader this aspect of food philosophy.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) the nature of the supporting information",

It was a story fit for a children’s film, and was widely shared online. Part of the fun of the story and other such tales of escape, involving creatures as diverse as rats and llamas, is indulging in a bit of knowing anthropomorphism: animals, they’re just like us! In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced, because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own. How is it that eight-tentacled sea creatures can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as portable armor and even exhibit sophisticated play behavior?\nAnthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that it is not in fact anthropomorphising, but its opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals, or what he terms anthropodenial – that has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Analysing decades of animal-cognition research, he shows that, with the exception of fully-developed language, animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals: the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. Animals, in other words, are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.\nAnthropodenial, in de Waal’s opinion, is a relatively modern phenomenon. In medieval and early modern Europe, the animal mind was considered sophisticated enough that animals could be put on trial for crimes. And as recently as the nineteenth century, many naturalists sought out the connections between human and animal intelligence. ‘The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind,’ one nineteenth-century naturalist wrote. And this was no radical supporter of animal rights; it was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution changed the way we understand our place in the world.\nThe advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on conditioning animals through reward and punishment, shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, the two dominant schools of thought viewed animals as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Anyone who thought about animals having internal lives was dismissed as romantic, or unscientific. It is perhaps no accident that this shift occurred during the same century that saw humans tearing down animal habitats at unprecedented rates, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock which ignored the welfare of the animals.\nHappily, de Waal believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. ‘The times are changing,’ he writes. ‘Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last few decades, diffused over the internet.’ The most effective tests of animal intelligence, he argues, are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but whereas we need apps to find our misplaced phones, they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery points out that if an octopus were to measure human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us fail the test, it might conclude that we are pretty stupid.\nDe Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to a drain leading to the ocean.  But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. When the monkeys were rewarded with either cucumbers (a well-liked monkey food) or grapes (an even better one), those given cucumbers shrieked and raged at seeing their peers get the superior treat. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later. Just one of the oddities of our particular kind of animal mind.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) Their human-like behaviour surprises people more as they are so unlike humans in appearance.",

The passage actually emphasizes that octopuses are particularly intelligent and capable of escaping, which makes their escapes notable.\n\n- **Option C**: \"People still underestimate their intelligence despite what is known about their abilities.\"\n  - This aligns well with the passage. The first paragraph mentions that stories like Inky's are seen as fitting for children's films, implying that people often view octopuses as playful and not necessarily intelligent. The passage also notes that octopuses' intelligence is surprising given their dissimilar bodies, suggesting underestimation.\n\n- **Option D**: \"Their human-like behavior surprises people more as they are so unlike humans in appearance.\"\n  - While the passage does mention that octopuses' intelligence is surprising due to their dissimilar bodies, it does not specifically state that their human-like behavior is what surprises people more.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is the one that best captures the point made about octopuses in the first paragraph. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n(C) People still underestimate their intelligence despite what is known about their abilities.",

It also touches on the broader topic of animal intelligence, particularly focusing on octopuses and their surprising behaviors.\n\n2. **First Paragraph Analysis**:\n   - The paragraph begins with the story of Inky's escape, which is described as \"a story fit for a children’s film.\"\n   - It mentions that such stories are shared online and that they involve \"knowing anthropomorphism,\" where animals are likened to humans.\n   - The passage highlights the octopus's intelligence, noting that they can perform complex tasks like opening jars, recognizing faces, and exhibiting sophisticated play behavior.\n\n3. **Key Points in the First Paragraph**:\n   - The story of Inky's escape is entertaining and widely shared.\n   - The octopus's intelligence is emphasized, and it is noted that their abilities are surprising given their dissimilar appearance to humans.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) Their playful nature would make them a good subject for a children’s film.\n     - This option is partially correct, as the story of Inky's escape is indeed entertaining and could be a good subject for a children's film. However, it doesn't fully capture the main point about the octopus's intelligence.\n   - (B) They are no more likely to be able to escape captivity than any other creature.\n     - This option is incorrect. The passage actually suggests that Inky's escape was surprising and notable.\n   - (C) People still underestimate their intelligence despite what is known about their abilities.\n     - This option is not directly supported by the first paragraph. The paragraph does not discuss the general public's perception of octopus intelligence.\n   - (D) Their human-like behavior surprises people more as they are so unlike humans in appearance.\n     - This option is the most accurate. The passage emphasizes that the octopus's intelligence and behaviors are surprising and noteworthy, especially given their dissimilar appearance to humans.\n\n**Conclusion**: The point the writer makes about octopuses in the first paragraph is best captured by option (D): Their human-like behavior surprises people more as they are so unlike humans in appearance."

It was a story fit for a children’s film, and was widely shared online. Part of the fun of the story and other such tales of escape, involving creatures as diverse as rats and llamas, is indulging in a bit of knowing anthropomorphism: animals, they’re just like us! In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced, because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own. How is it that eight-tentacled sea creatures can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as portable armor and even exhibit sophisticated play behavior?\nAnthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that it is not in fact anthropomorphising, but its opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals, or what he terms anthropodenial – that has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Analysing decades of animal-cognition research, he shows that, with the exception of fully-developed language, animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals: the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. Animals, in other words, are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.\nAnthropodenial, in de Waal’s opinion, is a relatively modern phenomenon. In medieval and early modern Europe, the animal mind was considered sophisticated enough that animals could be put on trial for crimes. And as recently as the nineteenth century, many naturalists sought out the connections between human and animal intelligence. ‘The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind,’ one nineteenth-century naturalist wrote. And this was no radical supporter of animal rights; it was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution changed the way we understand our place in the world.\nThe advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on conditioning animals through reward and punishment, shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, the two dominant schools of thought viewed animals as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Anyone who thought about animals having internal lives was dismissed as romantic, or unscientific. It is perhaps no accident that this shift occurred during the same century that saw humans tearing down animal habitats at unprecedented rates, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock which ignored the welfare of the animals.\nHappily, de Waal believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. ‘The times are changing,’ he writes. ‘Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last few decades, diffused over the internet.’ The most effective tests of animal intelligence, he argues, are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but whereas we need apps to find our misplaced phones, they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery points out that if an octopus were to measure human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us fail the test, it might conclude that we are pretty stupid.\nDe Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to a drain leading to the ocean.  But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. When the monkeys were rewarded with either cucumbers (a well-liked monkey food) or grapes (an even better one), those given cucumbers shrieked and raged at seeing their peers get the superior treat. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later. Just one of the oddities of our particular kind of animal mind.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) came to a conclusion based on existing data.",

Animals, in other words, are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.\nAnthropodenial, in de Waal’s opinion, is a relatively modern phenomenon. In medieval and early modern Europe, the animal mind was considered sophisticated enough that animals could be put on trial for crimes. And as recently as the nineteenth century, many naturalists sought out the connections between human and animal intelligence. ‘The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind,’ one nineteenth-century naturalist wrote. And this was no radical supporter of animal rights; it was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution changed the way we understand our place in the world.\nThe advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on conditioning animals through reward and punishment, shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, the two dominant schools of thought viewed animals as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Anyone who thought about animals having internal lives was dismissed as romantic, or unscientific. It is perhaps no accident that this shift occurred during the same century that saw humans tearing down animal habitats at unprecedented rates, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock which ignored the welfare of the animals.\nHappily, de Waal believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. ‘The times are changing,’ he writes. ‘Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last few decades, diffused over the internet.’ The most effective tests of animal intelligence, he argues, are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but whereas we need apps to find our misplaced phones, they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery points out that if an octopus were to measure human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us fail the test, it might conclude that we are pretty stupid.\nDe Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to a drain leading to the ocean.  But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. When the monkeys were rewarded with either cucumbers (a well-liked monkey food) or grapes (an even better one), those given cucumbers shrieked and raged at seeing their peers get the superior treat. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later.

It was a story fit for a children’s film, and was widely shared online. Part of the fun of the story and other such tales of escape, involving creatures as diverse as rats and llamas, is indulging in a bit of knowing anthropomorphism: animals, they’re just like us! In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced, because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own. How is it that eight-tentacled sea creatures can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as portable armor and even exhibit sophisticated play behavior?\nAnthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that it is not in fact anthropomorphising, but its opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals, or what he terms anthropodenial – that has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Analysing decades of animal-cognition research, he shows that, with the exception of fully-developed language, animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals: the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. Animals, in other words, are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.\nAnthropodenial, in de Waal’s opinion, is a relatively modern phenomenon. In medieval and early modern Europe, the animal mind was considered sophisticated enough that animals could be put on trial for crimes. And as recently as the nineteenth century, many naturalists sought out the connections between human and animal intelligence. ‘The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind,’ one nineteenth-century naturalist wrote. And this was no radical supporter of animal rights; it was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution changed the way we understand our place in the world.\nThe advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on conditioning animals through reward and punishment, shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, the two dominant schools of thought viewed animals as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Anyone who thought about animals having internal lives was dismissed as romantic, or unscientific. It is perhaps no accident that this shift occurred during the same century that saw humans tearing down animal habitats at unprecedented rates, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock which ignored the welfare of the animals.\nHappily, de Waal believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. ‘The times are changing,’ he writes. ‘Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last few decades, diffused over the internet.’ The most effective tests of animal intelligence, he argues, are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but whereas we need apps to find our misplaced phones, they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery points out that if an octopus were to measure human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us fail the test, it might conclude that we are pretty stupid.\nDe Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to a drain leading to the ocean.  But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. When the monkeys were rewarded with either cucumbers (a well-liked monkey food) or grapes (an even better one), those given cucumbers shrieked and raged at seeing their peers get the superior treat. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later. Just one of the oddities of our particular kind of animal mind.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) a video has more impact on people than written data.",

While robots have been utilised in the automotive and manufacturing sectors for decades, experts now predict an imminent tipping point in robotic usage across many sectors – and say that much of the industrialised world simply isn’t prepared for this radical transition. Many of us recognise robotic automation as an inevitably disruptive force. However, in a classic example of optimism bias, while approximately two-thirds of people believe that robots will inevitably perform most of the work currently done by humans during the next 50 years, about 80% also believe their current jobs will either ‘definitely‘ or ‘probably‘ exist in their current form within the same timeframe. Somehow, we believe our livelihoods will be safe. They’re not: every commercial sector will be affected by robotic automation in the next several years.\nFor example, Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has developed a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 standard bricks in one hour – a task that would take two human bricklayers the better part of a day or longer to complete. Two years ago, San Francisco-based startup Simbe Robotics unveiled Tally, a robot that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers during regular business hours and ensures not, as might be expected, that the aisles are free from grime and rubbish, but that goods are adequately stocked, placed and priced.\nAdvocates for robotic automation routinely highlight the fact that, for the most part, robots cannot service or program themselves – yet. In theory, this will create new, highly-skilled jobs for technicians and programmers and other well-paid roles. Critics, on the other hand, warn that we mustn’t overlook the value of interpersonal skills at work. They say that society is not prepared for the upheaval that the downgrading of the human touch will bring.\nFew people understand this tension better than world expert on the commercial applications of robotics technology, Dr Jing Bing Zhang. As research director for global marketing intelligence firm IDC, Zhang investigates the way in which robotics is shaping tomorrow’s working population. A recent report by Zhang and his team regarding general trends says that within two years almost one-third of robots will be smarter, more efficient robots, which are capable of collaborating with other robots and working safely alongside humans. Within three years, 30% or more of the world’s leading companies will have a designated chief robotics officer, and several governments around the world will have drafted or implemented specific legislation surrounding robots. Within five years, average salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60% – yet more than one-third of the available jobs in robotics will remain vacant due to shortages of skilled workers. ‘Automation and robotics will definitely impact lower-skilled people, which is unfortunate,’ Zhang told me via phone from his Singapore office. ‘I think the only way for them to move up or adapt is not to hope that the government will protect their jobs from technology, but look for ways to retrain themselves. No one can expect to do the same thing for life. That’s just not the case any more.’\nMeanwhile, developments in motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will inevitably give rise to an entirely new class of robots aimed predominantly at consumer markets – robots the likes of which we have never seen before. Upright, bipedal robots that live alongside us in our homes; robots that interact with us in increasingly sophisticated ways – in short, robots that were once the sole province of the realms of science fiction. This, according to Zhang, represents an unparalleled opportunity for companies positioned to take advantage of this shift. Yet it also poses significant challenges, such as the necessity for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.\nWith millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow. In an increasingly unstable employment market, developed nations desperately need more science, technology, engineering and maths – commonly abbreviated as STEM – graduates to remain competitive.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) They mistakenly believe it will have little effect on their employment prospects.

While robots have been utilised in the automotive and manufacturing sectors for decades, experts now predict an imminent tipping point in robotic usage across many sectors – and say that much of the industrialised world simply isn’t prepared for this radical transition. Many of us recognise robotic automation as an inevitably disruptive force. However, in a classic example of optimism bias, while approximately two-thirds of people believe that robots will inevitably perform most of the work currently done by humans during the next 50 years, about 80% also believe their current jobs will either ‘definitely‘ or ‘probably‘ exist in their current form within the same timeframe. Somehow, we believe our livelihoods will be safe. They’re not: every commercial sector will be affected by robotic automation in the next several years.\nFor example, Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has developed a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 standard bricks in one hour – a task that would take two human bricklayers the better part of a day or longer to complete. Two years ago, San Francisco-based startup Simbe Robotics unveiled Tally, a robot that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers during regular business hours and ensures not, as might be expected, that the aisles are free from grime and rubbish, but that goods are adequately stocked, placed and priced.\nAdvocates for robotic automation routinely highlight the fact that, for the most part, robots cannot service or program themselves – yet. In theory, this will create new, highly-skilled jobs for technicians and programmers and other well-paid roles. Critics, on the other hand, warn that we mustn’t overlook the value of interpersonal skills at work. They say that society is not prepared for the upheaval that the downgrading of the human touch will bring.\nFew people understand this tension better than world expert on the commercial applications of robotics technology, Dr Jing Bing Zhang. As research director for global marketing intelligence firm IDC, Zhang investigates the way in which robotics is shaping tomorrow’s working population. A recent report by Zhang and his team regarding general trends says that within two years almost one-third of robots will be smarter, more efficient robots, which are capable of collaborating with other robots and working safely alongside humans. Within three years, 30% or more of the world’s leading companies will have a designated chief robotics officer, and several governments around the world will have drafted or implemented specific legislation surrounding robots. Within five years, average salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60% – yet more than one-third of the available jobs in robotics will remain vacant due to shortages of skilled workers. ‘Automation and robotics will definitely impact lower-skilled people, which is unfortunate,’ Zhang told me via phone from his Singapore office. ‘I think the only way for them to move up or adapt is not to hope that the government will protect their jobs from technology, but look for ways to retrain themselves. No one can expect to do the same thing for life. That’s just not the case any more.’\nMeanwhile, developments in motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will inevitably give rise to an entirely new class of robots aimed predominantly at consumer markets – robots the likes of which we have never seen before. Upright, bipedal robots that live alongside us in our homes; robots that interact with us in increasingly sophisticated ways – in short, robots that were once the sole province of the realms of science fiction. This, according to Zhang, represents an unparalleled opportunity for companies positioned to take advantage of this shift. Yet it also poses significant challenges, such as the necessity for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.\nWith millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow. In an increasingly unstable employment market, developed nations desperately need more science, technology, engineering and maths – commonly abbreviated as STEM – graduates to remain competitive.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) monitor the availability of supplies on the shelves.",

While robots have been utilised in the automotive and manufacturing sectors for decades, experts now predict an imminent tipping point in robotic usage across many sectors – and say that much of the industrialised world simply isn’t prepared for this radical transition. Many of us recognise robotic automation as an inevitably disruptive force. However, in a classic example of optimism bias, while approximately two-thirds of people believe that robots will inevitably perform most of the work currently done by humans during the next 50 years, about 80% also believe their current jobs will either ‘definitely‘ or ‘probably‘ exist in their current form within the same timeframe. Somehow, we believe our livelihoods will be safe. They’re not: every commercial sector will be affected by robotic automation in the next several years.\nFor example, Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has developed a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 standard bricks in one hour – a task that would take two human bricklayers the better part of a day or longer to complete. Two years ago, San Francisco-based startup Simbe Robotics unveiled Tally, a robot that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers during regular business hours and ensures not, as might be expected, that the aisles are free from grime and rubbish, but that goods are adequately stocked, placed and priced.\nAdvocates for robotic automation routinely highlight the fact that, for the most part, robots cannot service or program themselves – yet. In theory, this will create new, highly-skilled jobs for technicians and programmers and other well-paid roles. Critics, on the other hand, warn that we mustn’t overlook the value of interpersonal skills at work. They say that society is not prepared for the upheaval that the downgrading of the human touch will bring.\nFew people understand this tension better than world expert on the commercial applications of robotics technology, Dr Jing Bing Zhang. As research director for global marketing intelligence firm IDC, Zhang investigates the way in which robotics is shaping tomorrow’s working population. A recent report by Zhang and his team regarding general trends says that within two years almost one-third of robots will be smarter, more efficient robots, which are capable of collaborating with other robots and working safely alongside humans. Within three years, 30% or more of the world’s leading companies will have a designated chief robotics officer, and several governments around the world will have drafted or implemented specific legislation surrounding robots. Within five years, average salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60% – yet more than one-third of the available jobs in robotics will remain vacant due to shortages of skilled workers. ‘Automation and robotics will definitely impact lower-skilled people, which is unfortunate,’ Zhang told me via phone from his Singapore office. ‘I think the only way for them to move up or adapt is not to hope that the government will protect their jobs from technology, but look for ways to retrain themselves. No one can expect to do the same thing for life. That’s just not the case any more.’\nMeanwhile, developments in motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will inevitably give rise to an entirely new class of robots aimed predominantly at consumer markets – robots the likes of which we have never seen before. Upright, bipedal robots that live alongside us in our homes; robots that interact with us in increasingly sophisticated ways – in short, robots that were once the sole province of the realms of science fiction. This, according to Zhang, represents an unparalleled opportunity for companies positioned to take advantage of this shift. Yet it also poses significant challenges, such as the necessity for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.\nWith millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow. In an increasingly unstable employment market, developed nations desperately need more science, technology, engineering and maths – commonly abbreviated as STEM – graduates to remain competitive.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) evaluating the impact of technological advancement.",

The reporter, in forming his inquiry, was undoubtedly expressing a common sentiment: the general public has an unending desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams; it challenges a certain type of person to face the unknown. Yet its real merit lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.\nAn important essay on climbing is ‘Games that Climbers Play’, 1967, by the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven distinct climbing activities, or ‘games’, from playing around on boulders to scaling Himalayan peaks, each with its own set of rules. And he maintained that the style used to tackle any climb – for example, using more or less equipment – has to depend on the rules of that particular game. Over the intervening years, this approach to climbing has rightly come to dominate climbing discourse in the West as it is expressed in everything from climbing magazines to fire-side debates.\nFor many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom. \nWhen presented with the question ‘Why climb?’ the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction in his recent essay. Fitschen argues that a better question would be ‘Why do people climb?’ This way, Fitschen asks about our species and gives an evolutionary explanation for why we climb. Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits, even if there are risks involved. Thus the pleasures we get from climbing have more to do with biology than any rational process. \nAnother significant contribution was made in a recent essay by US academic Brian Treanor, who proposes that climbing helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. While Treanor acknowledges that these are not the only favourable characteristics that climbing has the potential to develop, and that not all climbers exhibit these virtues, he thinks developing these virtues is particularly important in our modernized and risk-averse world. Climbing, then, serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world. \nOne further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed. Expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson caused a degree of controversy by claiming it is because the climb is harder or riskier when done independently that such climbing achievements deserve greater recognition than those completed by large teams or aided by artificial means, such as bottled oxygen supplies at high altitude. The crux of the issue seems to have been that the essay may have encouraged some in the climbing fraternity to expose themselves to unnecessary dangers. \nIt is also possible to inquire into climbing by leaving the Western tradition. Being in the moment, in the zone, or going with the flow are all common experiences reported by climbers. The physical work involved on a climb, the active meditation while on a route and the problem solving that is intuitive rather than logical, are all fundamental parts of climbing. So much so that it has been argued that the discipline of climbing parallels many of the techniques used in Zen philosophy to train the mind towards reaching a state of perfect peace. In this, then, people may find one further idea to consider when asking why men and women are drawn to climbing.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) approval of Mallory’s vague reply to the reporter’s question.",

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the passage and analyze the writer's perspective on George Mallory's comment.\n\n1. The passage begins by discussing George Mallory's famous response, \"Because it's there,\" to a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. The reporter's question reflects a common sentiment that the general public finds the pursuit of climbing Everest to be seemingly meaningless and life-threatening.\n\n2. The passage then delves into various perspectives on why people climb, including the idea that climbing is an adventure and fun, the concept of climbing as a game with different rules, the feeling of freedom it produces, and the evolutionary explanation for why humans are inclined to take on challenges.\n\n3. The passage also discusses the virtues that climbing can cultivate, such as courage, humility, and respect for the environment, and the idea that climbing can help develop traits that allow one to flourish in the non-climbing world.\n\n4. The passage mentions a controversy regarding climbers who do not rely on others or technology, suggesting that such achievements deserve greater recognition.\n\n5. Finally, the passage explores the parallels between climbing and Zen philosophy, suggesting that climbing can lead to a state of perfect peace.\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\n\n(A) Criticism of the reporter for asking an unreasonable question.\n(B) Approval of Mallory’s vague reply to the reporter’s question.\n(C) Surprise at the general public’s condemnation of extreme sports.\n(D) Amusement at Mallory’s inability to think of a more persuasive reply.\n\nThe passage does not explicitly criticize the reporter for asking an unreasonable question, nor does it express surprise at the general public's condemnation of extreme sports. It also does not indicate amusement at Mallory's inability to think of a more persuasive reply. However, the passage does seem to appreciate the generality of Mallory's response, as it is mentioned that the real merit of his answer lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting option is:\n\n(B) Approval of Mallory’s vague reply to the reporter’s question."

The reporter, in forming his inquiry, was undoubtedly expressing a common sentiment: the general public has an unending desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams; it challenges a certain type of person to face the unknown. Yet its real merit lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.\nAn important essay on climbing is ‘Games that Climbers Play’, 1967, by the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven distinct climbing activities, or ‘games’, from playing around on boulders to scaling Himalayan peaks, each with its own set of rules. And he maintained that the style used to tackle any climb – for example, using more or less equipment – has to depend on the rules of that particular game. Over the intervening years, this approach to climbing has rightly come to dominate climbing discourse in the West as it is expressed in everything from climbing magazines to fire-side debates.\nFor many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom. \nWhen presented with the question ‘Why climb?’ the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction in his recent essay. Fitschen argues that a better question would be ‘Why do people climb?’ This way, Fitschen asks about our species and gives an evolutionary explanation for why we climb. Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits, even if there are risks involved. Thus the pleasures we get from climbing have more to do with biology than any rational process. \nAnother significant contribution was made in a recent essay by US academic Brian Treanor, who proposes that climbing helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. While Treanor acknowledges that these are not the only favourable characteristics that climbing has the potential to develop, and that not all climbers exhibit these virtues, he thinks developing these virtues is particularly important in our modernized and risk-averse world. Climbing, then, serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world. \nOne further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed. Expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson caused a degree of controversy by claiming it is because the climb is harder or riskier when done independently that such climbing achievements deserve greater recognition than those completed by large teams or aided by artificial means, such as bottled oxygen supplies at high altitude. The crux of the issue seems to have been that the essay may have encouraged some in the climbing fraternity to expose themselves to unnecessary dangers. \nIt is also possible to inquire into climbing by leaving the Western tradition. Being in the moment, in the zone, or going with the flow are all common experiences reported by climbers. The physical work involved on a climb, the active meditation while on a route and the problem solving that is intuitive rather than logical, are all fundamental parts of climbing. So much so that it has been argued that the discipline of climbing parallels many of the techniques used in Zen philosophy to train the mind towards reaching a state of perfect peace.

        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's break down the question and the passage step by step to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Part of the Passage\nThe relevant part of the passage is the second paragraph, which begins with:\n\"For many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Content of the Second Paragraph\n- The paragraph discusses the paradoxical nature of climbing: it can feel both freeing and restrictive.\n- It mentions examples like being pinned down by storms, which can limit freedom.\n- The paragraph concludes with the statement, \"There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing.\"\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n- **Option A**: \"the way people climb should vary according to the context.\"\n  - This option is not directly supported by the second paragraph. The paragraph does not discuss how people should climb based on context but rather focuses on the paradox of freedom and restriction in climbing.\n\n- **Option B**: \"climbers ought to develop new approaches to their sport.\"\n  - This option is not addressed in the second paragraph. The paragraph does not suggest developing new approaches but rather talks about the paradox of climbing.\n\n- **Option C**: \"some climbs might receive too much attention from the media.\"\n  - This option is not mentioned in the second paragraph. The focus is on the paradox of climbing, not on media attention.\n\n- **Option D**: \"the process of climbing may be more rewarding than reaching the top.\"\n  - This option aligns with the conclusion of the second paragraph, which states that there is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. The paragraph implies that the experience of climbing, including the feeling of freedom and the restrictions, can be rewarding.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Correct Answer\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D: the process of climbing may be more rewarding than reaching the top.**\n\nThis option best captures the essence of the paragraph's conclusion regarding the paradox of climbing and the potential rewards of the process itself.",

The reporter, in forming his inquiry, was undoubtedly expressing a common sentiment: the general public has an unending desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams; it challenges a certain type of person to face the unknown. Yet its real merit lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.\nAn important essay on climbing is ‘Games that Climbers Play’, 1967, by the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven distinct climbing activities, or ‘games’, from playing around on boulders to scaling Himalayan peaks, each with its own set of rules. And he maintained that the style used to tackle any climb – for example, using more or less equipment – has to depend on the rules of that particular game. Over the intervening years, this approach to climbing has rightly come to dominate climbing discourse in the West as it is expressed in everything from climbing magazines to fire-side debates.\nFor many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom. \nWhen presented with the question ‘Why climb?’ the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction in his recent essay. Fitschen argues that a better question would be ‘Why do people climb?’ This way, Fitschen asks about our species and gives an evolutionary explanation for why we climb. Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits, even if there are risks involved. Thus the pleasures we get from climbing have more to do with biology than any rational process. \nAnother significant contribution was made in a recent essay by US academic Brian Treanor, who proposes that climbing helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. While Treanor acknowledges that these are not the only favourable characteristics that climbing has the potential to develop, and that not all climbers exhibit these virtues, he thinks developing these virtues is particularly important in our modernized and risk-averse world. Climbing, then, serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world. \nOne further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed. Expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson caused a degree of controversy by claiming it is because the climb is harder or riskier when done independently that such climbing achievements deserve greater recognition than those completed by large teams or aided by artificial means, such as bottled oxygen supplies at high altitude. The crux of the issue seems to have been that the essay may have encouraged some in the climbing fraternity to expose themselves to unnecessary dangers. \nIt is also possible to inquire into climbing by leaving the Western tradition. Being in the moment, in the zone, or going with the flow are all common experiences reported by climbers. The physical work involved on a climb, the active meditation while on a route and the problem solving that is intuitive rather than logical, are all fundamental parts of climbing. So much so that it has been argued that the discipline of climbing parallels many of the techniques used in Zen philosophy to train the mind towards reaching a state of perfect peace.

And he maintained that the style used to tackle any climb – for example, using more or less equipment – has to depend on the rules of that particular game. Over the intervening years, this approach to climbing has rightly come to dominate climbing discourse in the West as it is expressed in everything from climbing magazines to fire-side debates.\nFor many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom. \nWhen presented with the question ‘Why climb?’ the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction in his recent essay. Fitschen argues that a better question would be ‘Why do people climb?’ This way, Fitschen asks about our species and gives an evolutionary explanation for why we climb. Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits, even if there are risks involved. Thus the pleasures we get from climbing have more to do with biology than any rational process. \nAnother significant contribution was made in a recent essay by US academic Brian Treanor, who proposes that climbing helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. While Treanor acknowledges that these are not the only favourable characteristics that climbing has the potential to develop, and that not all climbers exhibit these virtues, he thinks developing these virtues is particularly important in our modernized and risk-averse world. Climbing, then, serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world. \nOne further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed. Expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson caused a degree of controversy by claiming it is because the climb is harder or riskier when done independently that such climbing achievements deserve greater recognition than those completed by large teams or aided by artificial means, such as bottled oxygen supplies at high altitude. The crux of the issue seems to have been that the essay may have encouraged some in the climbing fraternity to expose themselves to unnecessary dangers. \nIt is also possible to inquire into climbing by leaving the Western tradition. Being in the moment, in the zone, or going with the flow are all common experiences reported by climbers. The physical work involved on a climb, the active meditation while on a route and the problem solving that is intuitive rather than logical, are all fundamental parts of climbing. So much so that it has been argued that the discipline of climbing parallels many of the techniques used in Zen philosophy to train the mind towards reaching a state of perfect peace. In this, then, people may find one further idea to consider when asking why men and women are drawn to climbing.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) the less assistance climbers use, the more worthy they are of respect.",

The reporter, in forming his inquiry, was undoubtedly expressing a common sentiment: the general public has an unending desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit.

He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn’t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14. He listened to him play. Brendel explained, ‘He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note. It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing. One doesn’t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection’.\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains ‘When I was very young, I didn’t have the urge to be famous in five year’s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on. Although I do not have the physical power now, in my head, there are always things going on, all sorts of pieces that I’ve never played. I don’t play now but it’s a very nice new career.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) the total dedication of Brendel to his art",

The writer also notes Kit's potential and the need for patience and careful guidance as he continues to develop his skills.\n\nOption (A) is not the main focus of the first paragraph, as it only briefly mentions Kit's performance. Option (B) is not the primary emphasis either, as the writer does not discuss Brendel's dedication to his art in this context. Option (C) is not the main point, as the writer does not mention Brendel's reluctance to take on pupils in the first paragraph.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) the light-hearted nature of Brendel's character. While the writer does not explicitly mention Brendel's character, the overall tone of the passage, especially when discussing Brendel's reaction to Kit's performance and his own reflections on his career, suggests a sense of mellowness and appreciation for the young boy's talent.

He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn’t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14. He listened to him play. Brendel explained, ‘He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note. It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing. One doesn’t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection’.\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains ‘When I was very young, I didn’t have the urge to be famous in five year’s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on. Although I do not have the physical power now, in my head, there are always things going on, all sorts of pieces that I’ve never played. I don’t play now but it’s a very nice new career.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) it is unnecessary for an expert to teach people the basics.",

        "Phi35MiniInst_answer": "The quotation about the mountain guide is used by Brendel to illustrate option (B) that it is unwise to try to teach new skills before people are ready.\n\nIn the passage, Brendel initially dismisses the idea of teaching Kit Armstrong, a young boy who showed exceptional talent at the piano, as he had very few pupils and didn't see a reason to start now. He uses the analogy of a mountain guide to emphasize that just as a mountain guide is not suitable for teaching a child how to walk, he doesn't see himself as the right person to teach a young, talented musician.\n\nThis analogy supports the idea that it's not always appropriate or effective to teach someone a skill before they are ready, as they may not have the necessary foundation or maturity to fully grasp and benefit from the lessons. Brendel later recognizes Kit's exceptional talent and decides to make time for him, but he also warns against raising expectations and criticizing young, gifted players too harshly.\n\nThe other options (A, C, and D) do not align with the context of the quotation about the mountain guide in the passage.

However, after hearing the young boy play, he decides to give lessons.\n\n3. **Analyze the quote**: The original quote suggests that a mountain guide (an expert) wouldn't be expected to teach a child (a beginner) how to walk.

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "Let's analyze the passage step-by-step to determine what initially made Brendel decide to accept Kit as a pupil:\n\n1. **Initial Reaction**: The passage states that initially, Brendel didn't take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and didn't see the need to start now. This indicates that Brendel's initial reaction was not positive.\n\n2. **Reason for Initial Skepticism**: Brendel mentions, \"You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.\" This quote suggests that Brendel had a strong belief in his own abilities and felt that he didn't need additional students to teach basic skills.\n\n3. **The Turning Point**: The passage then describes an event that changed Brendel's mind. A young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel during a concert and asked for lessons. Brendel explains, \"But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14.\"\n\n4. **Kit's Performance**: After listening to Kit play, Brendel was impressed. He says, \"He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, ‘I have to make time for him.’”\n\n5. **Specific Impressions**: Brendel elaborates further on what impressed him:\n   - \"It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note.\"\n   - \"It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.\"\n\n6. **Further Impressions**: Brendel notes that Kit had an extraordinary talent:\n   - \"He played so beautifully that I thought to myself, ‘I have to make time for him.'\"\n   - \"To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself.\"\n   - \"Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader.\"\n   - \"But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something.\"\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on these points, Brendel decided to accept Kit as a pupil because of Kit's exceptional musical performance and his demonstrated talents, particularly his extraordinary memory and ability to listen and comprehend.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(D) He had an extraordinary talent.",

He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn’t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14.

It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing. One doesn’t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection’.\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains ‘When I was very young, I didn’t have the urge to be famous in five year’s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on.

Brendel is aware of Kit's exceptional abilities, such as his phenomenal memory, sight-reading skills, and sensitivity to sound. However, Brendel is concerned about the young musician's restlessness and impatience, as he is constantly learning new things and exploring other interests like languages, maths, and tennis.\n\nBrendel expresses his worry about the potential harm that could come from setting high expectations for Kit, especially if critics are expecting perfection. He emphasizes the importance of patience and experience in mastering the art of playing the piano.\n\nWhile the passage does not explicitly mention Brendel being worried about Kit being distracted by other interests (B), sad about Kit replacing him in the world of classical music (C), or frustrated that Kit is influenced by his mother (D), it does highlight Brendel's concern about Kit's rapid progress and the need for him to take his time and not rush into things.

He sees the potential for burnout and doesn't want to rush Kit's development. He uses the analogy of a mountain guide teaching a child to walk, highlighting his concern about overexertion.\n\n2. **Appreciative of Kit's talent:** Despite his reservations, Brendel is impressed by Kit's natural talent and musicality. He acknowledges Kit's exceptional ability to play with heart and understanding, and his remarkable memory and sensitivity to sound.\n\n3. **Worried about Kit's potential for burnout:**  Brendel is concerned that Kit's restless nature and diverse interests might lead to burnout. He wants to ensure Kit doesn't rush his progress and that he doesn't neglect the fundamentals of music.\n\n4. **Protective and supportive:**  Despite his reservations, Brendel is clearly invested in Kit's development.

He describes that Kit played \"remarkably well\" and had a \"phenomenal memory\" and \"was a phenomenal sight reader.\" Brendel found the performance so impressive that he decided to make time for Kit.\n\n3. **Future Expectations**: Later in the passage, Brendel expresses concern about raising expectations for Kit. He warns against newspapers naming him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, saying, \"One doesn’t say that in a newspaper.

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the relevant information in the passage regarding Kit Armstrong's musical abilities.\n\n2. The passage mentions several of Kit's musical abilities:\n   - He plays music by heart.\n   - He composed music.\n   - He has a phenomenal memory.\n   - He is a phenomenal sight reader.\n   - He has an ability to listen to his own playing.\n   - He listens carefully to Brendel's explanations.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the question: Which of Kit’s musical abilities does Brendel admire the most?\n\n4. To answer this, we need to consider Brendel's reaction to Kit's performances and abilities.

He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn’t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14. He listened to him play. Brendel explained, ‘He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note. It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing. One doesn’t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection’.\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains ‘When I was very young, I didn’t have the urge to be famous in five year’s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on. Although I do not have the physical power now, in my head, there are always things going on, all sorts of pieces that I’ve never played. I don’t play now but it’s a very nice new career.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) He realises he has said too much to a journalist.",

The context here is Brendel's worry about the negative impact of a newspaper article that labeled Kit Armstrong as the future great pianist of the 21st century. Brendel is concerned that such high expectations could be detrimental to the young musician, as he may not yet have the experience and maturity to consistently deliver the level of perfection expected.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) He resents the way that he has often been misquoted.\n\nThis option best captures Brendel's self-restraint and his concern about the potential harm caused by unrealistic expectations and misquotes about the young musician's abilities.

Specifically, it mentions Brendel's concern about media expectations and how they might affect Kit.\n\n2. **Key Phrase Analysis**: The phrase \"Brendel catches himself and looks severe\" appears in the context of Brendel's reaction to a particular article that named Kit as the future great pianist of the 21st century. This suggests that Brendel is aware of his own emotional response and the potential negative impact of such statements on Kit's development.\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **(A) He realises he has said too much to a journalist.**\n     - This option does not fit because the phrase \"catches himself\" indicates self-awareness rather than a realization of having spoken too much.\n   - **(B) He doesn’t enjoy giving interviews to journalists.**\n     - While this might be implied, it doesn't directly address why he \"catches himself.\"\n   - **(C) He wants to be careful he doesn’t upset any music critics.**\n     - This could be relevant, but it doesn't fully capture the self-awareness conveyed by \"catches himself.\"\n   - **(D) He resents the way that he has often been misquoted.**\n     - This fits well because it aligns with the idea that Brendel is aware of the potential harm caused by misquoting, and he is concerned about managing expectations.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the self-awareness conveyed by \"catches himself,\" the most appropriate answer is that Brendel is concerned about the way he might be misrepresented, which aligns with his desire to manage expectations carefully.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(D) He resents the way that he has often been misquoted.**",

Brendel is initially hesitant to take on a student, but is impressed by Kit's abilities.\n* **The Journalist's Question:** The passage mentions that Brendel is \"very cross\" about a newspaper article that labeled Kit as the \"future great pianist of the 21st century.\" This suggests that Brendel is concerned about the pressure and expectations that come with such a label.\n* **Brendel's Reaction:**  The phrase \"catches himself\" indicates a moment of self-awareness and a sudden realization of his own feelings.\n\n**Analyzing the Phrase**\n\n* **\"Catches himself\"** implies that Brendel is aware of his own reaction to the journalist's question. He is likely feeling frustrated and annoyed by the article's premature praise for Kit. \n* **The Implied Meaning:**  The phrase suggests that Brendel is trying to temper his own expectations and avoid setting unrealistic expectations for Kit. He wants to be careful not to create pressure on the young musician.\n\n**Answering the Question**\n\nThe most accurate answer is **(C) He wants to be careful he doesn’t upset any music critics.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe passage clearly shows that Brendel is concerned about the negative impact of premature praise on Kit's development.

The quote in question appears towards the end of the passage.\n\n2. **Understand the Phrase**: In line 51, Brendel says, \"But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.\"\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**: The phrase \"catches himself\" suggests that Brendel feels he might be saying too much or revealing too much about Kit's abilities, which could potentially lead to overestimation or premature expectations.\n\n4. **Reason for the Phrase**: The context indicates that Brendel has already mentioned some impressive qualities of Kit Armstrong. However, he seems to realize that these comments might give people the wrong impression about Kit's abilities. This realization prompts him to caution against such expectations.\n\n5. **Option Analysis**:\n   - Option (A) suggests Brendel realizes he has said too much to a journalist, which isn't directly supported by the passage.\n   - Option (B) implies Brendel dislikes giving interviews, but the passage doesn't indicate a dislike for interviews specifically.\n   - Option (C) states Brendel wants to be careful about upsetting music critics, which is also not directly supported.\n   - Option (D) aligns with the idea that Brendel resents being overly praised or having his students prematurely labeled as the next great pianist.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most fitting option is:\n\n(D) He resents the way that he has often been misquoted.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"catches himself\" in line 51 reflects Brendel's realization that his words might lead to premature or exaggerated expectations about Kit Armstrong's abilities, causing him to temper his praise and express caution.",

        "processed_text": "What is the writer’s main point about the video games industry in the first paragraph?\nOptions:\n(A) It is reasonable to consider making a living in this field.\n(B) Young people’s contributions to it should be appreciated.\n(C) It offers a relatively limited number of career options.\n(D) Specialists in this area have failed to value its potential.\nReference Passage: Initially populated by computer scientists and the self-taught, the game design industry used not to offer many routes into its midst. Often, perhaps unfairly, viewed as just a hobby for young enthusiasts, the video games industry is now being taken seriously. Surprised? Industry experts aren’t.\nIt’s not easy though. Video game spin-offs that rapidly follow any new movie require dozens of team members and months of incredible skill, perseverance and intricacies. As with almost every industry, it’s tricky to get into – but it is expanding. Jim Donelly, a spokesman for an online games magazine says: ‘It’s certainly very difficult to make much headway within big companies, or to influence any of the really big mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.’\nSo, how can you get into such a competitive industry? Although many companies prefer people  to have a degree in computer science, Jim disagrees. ‘There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something, and you won’t get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff. Game design is less a job than it is a way of life. Like any creative endeavour it must be done to be real.’ Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s really more complicated than that. There are lots of people who want to work in games, but few who measure up to the requirements of the industry these days; even fewer who have the creative talent, technical know-how, vision and entrepreneurial ability to really contribute to the ever-changing face of an evolving medium.’\nCan you do it on your own? ‘Perhaps, but it’s pretty tricky,’ says John. ‘However, a good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. Most games designers start their careers as programmers, or artists, progressing their way up the ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment media, plus have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. They may or may not have spent a few years in the working world post-graduation, but have realised that games is going to be their “thing”. They are not merely fans, but are fascinated by the future possibilities of games, and are aware of the increasing breadth and diversity of the form. And finally connections can help.

Often, perhaps unfairly, viewed as just a hobby for young enthusiasts, the video games industry is now being taken seriously. Surprised? Industry experts aren’t.\nIt’s not easy though. Video game spin-offs that rapidly follow any new movie require dozens of team members and months of incredible skill, perseverance and intricacies. As with almost every industry, it’s tricky to get into – but it is expanding. Jim Donelly, a spokesman for an online games magazine says: ‘It’s certainly very difficult to make much headway within big companies, or to influence any of the really big mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.’\nSo, how can you get into such a competitive industry? Although many companies prefer people  to have a degree in computer science, Jim disagrees. ‘There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something, and you won’t get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff. Game design is less a job than it is a way of life. Like any creative endeavour it must be done to be real.’ Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s really more complicated than that. There are lots of people who want to work in games, but few who measure up to the requirements of the industry these days; even fewer who have the creative talent, technical know-how, vision and entrepreneurial ability to really contribute to the ever-changing face of an evolving medium.’\nCan you do it on your own? ‘Perhaps, but it’s pretty tricky,’ says John. ‘However, a good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. Most games designers start their careers as programmers, or artists, progressing their way up the ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment media, plus have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. They may or may not have spent a few years in the working world post-graduation, but have realised that games is going to be their “thing”. They are not merely fans, but are fascinated by the future possibilities of games, and are aware of the increasing breadth and diversity of the form. And finally connections can help.

Here, 'that' refers to the action or process of creating games.\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n(B) making games\n\nThis is because 'that' is used to describe the method or approach to enter the industry, which is through creating games. The other options (A, C, and D) are not directly related to the context of 'that' in this specific line.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "To answer the question about what 'that' refers to in line 33, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the context**: The passage discusses the game design industry and how to enter it. It mentions different opinions from industry experts regarding the necessary qualifications and experience.\n\n2. **Locate line 33**: In the provided reference passage, line 33 states, \"But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever.\"\n\n3. **Determine the antecedent**: We need to find out what 'that' refers to in this sentence. The phrase \"the truth is\" often introduces a summary or conclusion based on previous statements. We should look at the preceding sentences to understand what 'that' is referring to.\n\n4. **Analyze the preceding sentences**:\n   - Jim Donelly's statement emphasizes the difficulty of entering big companies and influencing mainstream games but also mentions that the industry needs game designers.\n   - John Field suggests that while making games is crucial, it's more complex than just doing so.\n   \n5. **Identify the core message**: Both experts agree that the game design industry values game designers despite the challenges. This is the central point that 'that' likely refers to.\n\n6. **Match with the options**:\n   - (A) Getting a degree in computer science: While mentioned, it's not the main point of the last sentence.\n   - (B) Making games: This aligns closely with the experts' emphasis on the necessity of game designers.\n   - (C) Being independent: Not directly related to the concluding statement.\n   - (D) Seeing other options: Refers to considering various paths, which is not the main focus of the concluding statement.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**(B) making games**\n\nThis option best fits the context and meaning of the concluding statement, where 'that' refers to the industry's need for game designers.",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Let's break down the question and the passage to find the answer.\n\n**Understanding the Question**\n\nThe question asks us to identify what \"that\" refers to in line 33.  We need to find the noun or noun phrase that \"that\" is modifying.\n\n**Analyzing the Passage**\n\n* **Line 33:**  \"Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options.\"\n\n**Finding the Answer**\n\n* **\"Other options\"** is the noun phrase that \"that\" modifies. \n\n**Therefore, the answer is (D) seeing other options.** \n\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe sentence is saying that John Field sees alternative paths to entering the game design industry besides just making games. \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer the question about what \"that\" refers to in line 33, we need to identify the context in which \"that\" appears and trace its usage throughout the passage.\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant section of the passage.\nThe reference to line 33 is in the last paragraph, where the experts discuss various ways to enter the game design industry.\n\nStep 2: Locate line 33.\nUnfortunately, the exact line 33 is not provided in the given text. However, based on the context, we can infer that \"line 33\" would likely be part of the discussion about making games as a route into the industry.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the surrounding context.\nIn the last paragraph, we find this sentence: \"Jim disagrees. 'There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won't get a job if you haven't made something, and you won't get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff.'\"\n\nHere, \"make games\" is discussed as the only route to entry into the industry. The phrase \"the only route\" suggests that this is the main point being emphasized.\n\nStep 4: Determine what \"that\" refers to.\nGiven the context, \"that\" most likely refers back to \"make games,\" as it's the subject of disagreement and emphasis in the preceding sentence.\n\nTherefore, based on the context provided and the structure of the passage, the answer to the question \"What does ‘that’ refer to in line 33?\" is:\n\n(D) making games\n\nThis option fits best with the idea that making games is seen as the only clear path to entry into the game design industry according to the passage.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To determine what 'that' refers to in line 33, let's first identify the context of the sentence in which 'that' appears:\n\n‘Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.’\n\nIn this sentence, 'that' is used to refer to a specific group of people within the video game industry. The sentence contrasts two types of people: those who are at the director level and those who are lower-level designers. The phrase 'that' is used to introduce the second group, which is the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\n(A) getting a degree in computer science\n(B) making games\n(C) being independent\n(D) seeing other options\n\nNone of these options directly match the group of people being referred to in the sentence. However, the closest option that could be indirectly related to the context of the sentence is (B) making games, as it is mentioned in the passage that game designers are needed and that making games is a way to get into the industry. But 'that' specifically refers to the lower-level people, not the act of making games itself.\n\nTherefore, none of the options (A), (B), (C), or (D) correctly identify what 'that' refers to in line 33. The correct answer is not listed among the options provided. 'That' refers to the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces within the video game industry."

Often, perhaps unfairly, viewed as just a hobby for young enthusiasts, the video games industry is now being taken seriously. Surprised? Industry experts aren’t.\nIt’s not easy though. Video game spin-offs that rapidly follow any new movie require dozens of team members and months of incredible skill, perseverance and intricacies. As with almost every industry, it’s tricky to get into – but it is expanding. Jim Donelly, a spokesman for an online games magazine says: ‘It’s certainly very difficult to make much headway within big companies, or to influence any of the really big mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.’\nSo, how can you get into such a competitive industry? Although many companies prefer people  to have a degree in computer science, Jim disagrees. ‘There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something, and you won’t get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff. Game design is less a job than it is a way of life. Like any creative endeavour it must be done to be real.’ Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s really more complicated than that. There are lots of people who want to work in games, but few who measure up to the requirements of the industry these days; even fewer who have the creative talent, technical know-how, vision and entrepreneurial ability to really contribute to the ever-changing face of an evolving medium.’\nCan you do it on your own? ‘Perhaps, but it’s pretty tricky,’ says John. ‘However, a good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. Most games designers start their careers as programmers, or artists, progressing their way up the ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment media, plus have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. They may or may not have spent a few years in the working world post-graduation, but have realised that games is going to be their “thing”. They are not merely fans, but are fascinated by the future possibilities of games, and are aware of the increasing breadth and diversity of the form. And finally connections can help. This is often overlooked, but in order to get ahead in games – as in many other areas – you need to network.’\nThe childish stereotype of the adolescent boy glued to his games console has long been replaced by the more accurate perception of a grown-up medium, grabbing our attention. Families frequently get involved on interactive consoles. Smart phones introduce a wealth of new games through apps, as well as social media. John believes there is plenty of room for expansion. ‘Games have become pervasive play-things for increasingly large audiences. They are also a great way to learn things and I see this already big area as an expanding array of possibilities and opportunities.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) Many people lack the qualities needed to do effective work in the industry.",

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's analyze the passage step by step and see which option aligns with John’s perspective on what people who become games designers need to do.\n\n1. **Initial Context**: The passage discusses the evolution of the game design industry, highlighting its growth and the increasing need for game designers. It mentions that the industry is now taken seriously and that there are various ways to enter it.\n\n2. **Jim Donelly's View**: Jim Donelly emphasizes that making games is the only route to getting a job in the industry. He states that game design is a way of life and that you need to make something to get a job and to progress independently.\n\n3. **John Field's View**: John Field adds that there are many people who want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements. He mentions that game designers need creative talent, technical know-how, vision, and entrepreneurial ability.\n\n4. **John's Perspective**: John elaborates on the complexity of breaking into the industry. He suggests that a good postgraduate course in games can be helpful, and that most game designers start their careers as programmers or artists, progressing up the ladder. He also notes that they are interested in all forms of entertainment media and have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. He emphasizes the importance of connections and networking.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: John believes that becoming a games designer requires a broad range of skills and interests, as well as a strong foundation in various fields. He does not suggest that people have a clear, predetermined path after their degree, nor does he imply that they feel superior to others. Instead, he highlights the need for a diverse skill set and the importance of making games and networking.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate option is:\n\n(B) have to be experts in a number of different but relevant fields.\n\nThis option aligns with John's view that game designers need a wide range of skills and interests, as well as a strong foundation in various fields."

        "processed_text": "Why did Sam Carter find the house at Reef Point for the screenwriter and his daughter?\nOptions:\n(A) He realised that they could no longer afford to live in Los Angeles.\n(B) He believed that Los Angeles had become too dangerous for them.\n(C) He hoped that it would help the screenwriter to be more productive.\n(D) He felt he did not get on with the screenwriter any more.\nReference Passage: It was because of Sam Carter that we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile. But now, with the hot weather, the place flowered with people.\nAnd so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity. My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind. Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\nRusty was a dog. My dog. When we first moved to Reef Point we hadn’t got a dog, so Rusty decided to remedy this. Accordingly he hung around. I chased him off and he returned, unrepentant. One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force. Rusty knew this and moved in a little nearer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us’.\nYou’re wrong Jane,’ replied my father. ‘He thinks we belong to him.’\nRusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners. He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. You’d have thought he’d have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\nWe had been swimming that day. Father, the deadline met, had driven down to Los Angeles to deliver the script in person, and Rusty and I had kept each other company in and out of the sea all afternoon. But now, the setting sun gold, it was getting cooler and we sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. They chose a wave and stood, a poem of balance, as the water curved up, riding the wave until it swept onto the sand.\nOne surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs.

This change is positive for Jane, as she enjoys the lively atmosphere and the company of others.\n* **Jane's Connection to Reef Point:** The passage emphasizes Jane's connection to the beach and her dog Rusty. She finds solace in the beach and enjoys spending time with Rusty.\n\n**Answering the Question**\n\nThe passage clearly shows that Jane's attitude towards Reef Point shifts from initial disappointment to a more positive one. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (B) She understands why it isn’t very popular with visitors.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe passage describes Reef Point as \"uninviting\" and \"seldom patronised\" due to its location and the presence of a more popular resort nearby.

The second paragraph specifically discusses the popularity of Reef Point among visitors.\n\n2. **Analyze the text**: In the second paragraph, we see the following sentence: \"Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile.\"\n\n3. **Interpret Jane's attitude**: This sentence clearly shows that Jane recognizes the reasons why Reef Point isn't very popular with visitors. Specifically, it mentions two main factors:\n   - The uninviting road.\n   - The presence of a more attractive nearby resort (La Carmella).\n\n4. **Compare with the options**:\n   - (A) She is disappointed that the summer there has been unusually cloudy. This option doesn't align with the text.\n   - (B) She understands why it isn’t very popular with visitors. This aligns with the text, which explains the reasons for its low popularity.\n   - (C) She disapproves of the sort of people who come there. While Jane does recognize the reasons, there's no indication that she dislikes these people.\n   - (D) She wishes that it wasn’t so cut off from everywhere. While the road being uninviting might imply isolation, the passage doesn't suggest that Jane wishes it weren't cut off.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (B) She understands why it isn’t very popular with visitors.\n\nTherefore, we learn that Jane understands why Reef Point isn't very popular with visitors through the second paragraph.",

        "Phi35MiniInst_answer": "Based on the passage, Jane is making point (C) that her father was in a mood which was difficult for her to deal with. The passage describes her father's struggle to write a script due to the distracting environment at Reef Point. His frustration is evident when he throws a boot at Rusty, the dog, and his half-hearted attempt to assert control. Jane's observation of her father's behavior and his lack of enthusiasm further supports the idea that he was in a challenging mood. The other options (A, B, and D) are not directly supported by the information provided in the third paragraph.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant paragraph**: The third paragraph starts with \"And so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity.\"\n\n2. **Understand the context**: This paragraph describes the change in their living situation from isolation to being surrounded by people and activities.\n\n3. **Analyze the father's state of mind**: The passage mentions that \"My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind.\" This indicates that despite the change in surroundings, the father is still focused on his work but seems to be struggling with it.\n\n4. **Look for specific details about the father's mood**: The text states, \"Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\" This suggests that the father was so engrossed in his work that he wasn't even aware of his daughter's presence nearby.\n\n5. **Evaluate the options**:\n   - (A) He resented the arrival of strangers disturbing his peace.\n   - (B) He had found new inspiration in what was happening around him.\n   - (C) He was in a mood which was difficult for her to deal with.\n   - (D) He didn’t want her in the house distracting him.\n\n6. **Match the analysis with the options**:\n   - Option A doesn't fit because the passage doesn't mention resentment towards strangers.\n   - Option B isn't supported by the text; there's no indication of new inspiration.\n   - Option C aligns well with the father being unaware of his daughter's presence and focusing solely on his work.\n   - Option D is close but more specific; the passage doesn't explicitly say he didn't want her in the house, just that he was engrossed in his work.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best answer is:\n\n(C) He was in a mood which was difficult for her to deal with.\n\nThis option captures the essence of the father being so focused on his work that he was oblivious to his daughter's presence, making it challenging for her to interact with him normally.",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Here's a breakdown of the passage and the answer:\n\n**Understanding the Context**\n\n* **The passage focuses on the narrator's relationship with her father and their move to Reef Point.**  The narrator is trying to understand her father's behavior and how he's coping with the change in their life.\n* **The narrator's father is struggling to write.** He's under pressure from his agent and is in a difficult mental state.\n* **The narrator is observing her father's behavior and Rusty, her dog, who seems to be a source of comfort.**\n\n**Analyzing the Third Paragraph**\n\n* **The third paragraph is about the narrator's father's reaction to Rusty.** He throws a boot at Rusty, but it's clear he doesn't mean it seriously.\n* **The narrator's question, \"Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us,\" highlights the father's lack of understanding.** He doesn't see Rusty as a part of their family, but rather as a stray dog who has taken up residence.\n\n**Answering the Question**\n\nThe passage clearly shows that Jane is pointing out her father's **lack of understanding and his inability to see Rusty as part of their family.** He doesn't acknowledge Rusty's presence or see him as a companion. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (C) He was in a mood which was difficult for her to deal with.** \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore any other parts of the passage! \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this question, let's carefully analyze the reference passage and focus on the third paragraph:\n\n**Reference Passage excerpt:**\n\"Rusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners. He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. You'd have thought he'd have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\"\n\nThe key sentence that answers the question is: \"You'd have thought he'd have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze this sentence:\n- The speaker (Jane) expresses that Rusty would have been expected to become discouraged due to his inability to swim well.\n- However, the speaker adds \"(luckily) he never did,\" indicating that despite his lack of swimming ability, Rusty persisted and never lost interest.\n\nGiven this context, we can deduce that Jane is making the point that her father (the speaker's father) was in a mood which was difficult for her to deal with. This is because Rusty's persistence despite his lack of swimming ability mirrors the father's own challenging behavior described earlier in the passage.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n- (A) is incorrect because there's no mention of the father resenting visitors.\n- (B) is incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest the father found inspiration from the beach.\n- (C) is correct because the passage indicates the father's persistent attitude towards Rusty's swimming ability and his own persistent writing efforts despite the challenges.\n- (D) is incorrect because there's no mention of the father wanting her out of the house.\n\nTherefore, the point Jane is making about her father is best captured by option (C): He was in a mood which was difficult for her to deal with.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To determine what point Jane is making about her father in the third paragraph, let's break down the relevant part of the passage:\n\n\"One surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs. But now she seemed to decide to call it a day and rode in on a final wave.\nHi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’\n‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’\n‘You could get one.’\n‘No money.’\n‘Are you British?’\n‘No. I live here.’\n‘Is your father American?’\n‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he had written.’\n‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’\n‘Rufus Marsh.’\n‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that cover to cover’ She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. They were friendly but never interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning.\"\n\nIn this paragraph, Jane is describing a conversation she had with a surfer. The surfer asks why Jane didn't join them, and Jane explains that she doesn't have a surfboard and doesn't have money. The surfer then asks if Jane is British, and Jane clarifies that she lives here, not in Britain. The surfer then asks if Jane's father is American, and Jane responds that her father is not American but came here to write a film script.\n\nFrom this interaction, Jane is making the point that her father is not American, but rather a British writer who came to the area to work on a film script. This is reflected in option (D): \"He didn’t want her in the house distracting him.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(D) He didn’t want her in the house distracting him."

Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs.

One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force.

'He thinks we belong to him.'\"\n\nStep 2: Understand the context surrounding this statement.\nThe passage discusses Jane and her family moving to Reef Point, where Jane's father works as an agent in Los Angeles. The family is living there due to financial difficulties. Jane mentions that her dog, Rusty, who initially wasn't part of their household, decided to be around them. Initially, Jane chased Rusty away, but he returned unrepentantly. Jane then gives Rusty some water, and her father throws a boot at him. The passage continues to describe how Rusty behaves and the family's interactions with him.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the father's statement about Rusty.\nThe father says, \"He thinks we belong to him.\" This suggests that Rusty believes the family owns him or is his master. Given the context of Rusty initially coming to the family when they didn't have a dog and his persistent behavior, it implies that Rusty has formed a bond with the family and views them as his caregivers.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options given.\nA. \"didn’t mean to harm the dog\" - This doesn't align with the father's statement about Rusty thinking they belong to him.\nB. \"didn’t like the dog being around\" - There is no indication that the father dislikes Rusty's presence.\nC. \"had something more for the dog to drink\" - This is irrelevant to the father's statement.\nD. \"was trying to chase the dog away\" - This contradicts the father's statement and the previous context.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis.\nThe father's statement \"He thinks we belong to him\" directly supports option D, which states that the father was trying to chase the dog away.\n\nFinal Answer: (D) was trying to chase the dog away.",

        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Here's a breakdown of the answer and why:\n\n**Understanding the Passage**\n\nThe passage focuses on the narrator's life in Reef Point, her father's struggles, and her dog Rusty.  \n\n**The Fifth Paragraph**\n\nThe fifth paragraph is about Rusty's behavior and the narrator's observations about him. \n\n**Key Points**\n\n* **Rusty's digging:** Rusty loves the beach and digs up things, bringing them to the narrator.\n* **Rusty's ownership:** The narrator and her father disagree about who Rusty belongs to. The narrator believes Rusty thinks they belong to him, while her father believes the opposite.\n* **Rusty's swimming:** Rusty loves to swim and insists on going with the narrator, even though she's a better swimmer.\n\n**Implied Meaning**\n\nThe passage implies that Rusty is a playful and curious dog who enjoys the beach and is very attached to the narrator. He's not a typical, well-behaved dog, but he's clearly a part of the narrator's life and brings her joy. \n\n**Answer Choice Analysis**\n\n* **(A) Jane had to stop him digging on the beach.**  This is too specific and doesn't capture the full picture of Rusty's behavior.\n* **(B) The dog stole other people’s possessions.**  There's no evidence of this in the passage.\n* **(C) The dog followed Jane everywhere she went.**  While Rusty does accompany the narrator, the passage focuses on his digging and swimming.\n* **(D) Jane had to teach him to swim.**  The passage mentions Rusty loves to swim but doesn't suggest he needs to be taught.\n\n\n**Therefore, the best answer is (C) The dog followed Jane everywhere she went.** \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore other parts of the passage! \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's analyze the passage step-by-step:\n\n1. **Context Identification**: The passage describes Rusty, the narrator's dog, who has a habit of digging up items and sometimes taking them back to the narrator. This behavior causes the narrator to occasionally need to return these items to their owners.\n\n2. **Specific Behavior Mentioned**:\n   - Rusty digs things up on the beach.\n   - Rusty sometimes takes items (like a new sneaker or a beach towel) and brings them back to the narrator.\n   - The narrator has to return these items to their rightful owners.\n\n3. **Implication Analysis**:\n   - The fact that Rusty digs things up and brings them back suggests a certain level of curiosity and independence.\n   - The narrator mentions having to return these items, implying that Rusty is persistent in his actions and doesn't easily give up.\n   - There's no mention of Rusty stealing anything or following the narrator everywhere. Instead, it's more about Rusty's habits and the narrator's efforts to correct him.\n\n4. **Option Evaluation**:\n   - Option (A) is partially true; Rusty does dig on the beach and bring items back to the narrator, but the text does not imply that the narrator had to stop him.\n   - Option (B) is incorrect as there's no evidence that Rusty stole anything from others.\n   - Option (C) is also incorrect as there's no indication that Rusty follows the narrator everywhere.\n   - Option (D) is false; Rusty is not taught to swim, as the passage states he \"always insisted on accompanying\" the narrator, not that he learned to swim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the passage, the most implied statement about Rusty is that he has a habit of digging and retrieving items, which the narrator has to manage. However, this does not directly imply that the narrator had to stop him digging or teach him to swim. \n\nGiven the options provided and the information given in the passage, none of the choices perfectly match the implied behavior of Rusty. However, the closest option that aligns with the passage is:\n\n**(A) Jane had to stop him digging on the beach.**\n\nAlthough this is partially true, it is not the most accurate implication based on the text. The most fitting answer should focus on the narrator's management of Rusty's actions rather than stopping them. Therefore, the best choice among the given options is:\n\n**(A) Jane had to stop him digging on the beach.**",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To determine what is implied about Rusty the dog in the fifth paragraph, let's break down the relevant information from the passage:\n\n1. \"Rusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me.\"\n2. \"Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners.\"\n3. \"He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could.\"\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that Rusty the dog is very active and enjoys the beach. He frequently digs up items and brings them to his owner, Jane. Additionally, Rusty likes to swim and insists on swimming with Jane, even though she is a better swimmer.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Jane had to stop him digging on the beach.\n- This is not implied. The passage states that Rusty loves the beach and digs things up, but it does not mention that Jane had to stop him.\n\n(B) The dog stole other people’s possessions.\n- This is not implied. The passage mentions that Rusty brings things he digs up to Jane, not that he steals them.\n\n(C) The dog followed Jane everywhere she went.\n- This is not implied. The passage does not mention that Rusty followed Jane everywhere.\n\n(D) Jane had to teach him to swim.\n- This is not implied. The passage states that Rusty likes to swim and insists on swimming with Jane, but it does not mention that Jane had to teach him to swim.\n\nNone of the options (A), (B), (C), or (D) are directly supported by the passage. However, the passage does imply that Rusty is a playful and active dog who enjoys the beach and swimming. The closest option that aligns with the passage is (A), but it is not explicitly stated that Jane had to stop him digging. Therefore, based on the given options, none of them accurately capture the implied information about Rusty the dog in the fifth paragraph."

Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile. But now, with the hot weather, the place flowered with people.\nAnd so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity. My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind. Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\nRusty was a dog. My dog. When we first moved to Reef Point we hadn’t got a dog, so Rusty decided to remedy this. Accordingly he hung around. I chased him off and he returned, unrepentant. One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force. Rusty knew this and moved in a little nearer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us’.\nYou’re wrong Jane,’ replied my father. ‘He thinks we belong to him.’\nRusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners.

You’d have thought he’d have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\nWe had been swimming that day.

But now, the setting sun gold, it was getting cooler and we sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. They chose a wave and stood, a poem of balance, as the water curved up, riding the wave until it swept onto the sand.\nOne surfer in particular caught my eye.

The setting sun is described as \"gold,\" which suggests a warm and pleasant atmosphere. The writer and her dog Rusty are sitting and watching the surfers.

Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile. But now, with the hot weather, the place flowered with people.\nAnd so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity. My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind. Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\nRusty was a dog. My dog. When we first moved to Reef Point we hadn’t got a dog, so Rusty decided to remedy this. Accordingly he hung around. I chased him off and he returned, unrepentant. One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force. Rusty knew this and moved in a little nearer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us’.\nYou’re wrong Jane,’ replied my father. ‘He thinks we belong to him.’\nRusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners. He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. You’d have thought he’d have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\nWe had been swimming that day. Father, the deadline met, had driven down to Los Angeles to deliver the script in person, and Rusty and I had kept each other company in and out of the sea all afternoon. But now, the setting sun gold, it was getting cooler and we sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. They chose a wave and stood, a poem of balance, as the water curved up, riding the wave until it swept onto the sand.\nOne surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs. But now she seemed to decide to call it a day and rode in on a final wave.\nHi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’\n‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’\n‘You could get one.’\n‘No money.’\n‘You’re British, aren’t you? You visiting?’\n‘No I live here.’\n‘Is your father American?’\n‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he had written.’\n‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’\n‘Rufus Marsh.’\n‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that cover to cover’ She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. They were friendly but never interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) stop what she had been doing",

The queues, by now spilling out of the cattle shed marked ‘Departures’, to board the Queen Caroline where long and none was moving. ‘It’s best to get to the docks late’, her friend Annie had advised. ‘If you get there too early you can grow roots hanging about.’ Annie, married to a diplomat and full of advice, was a seasoned traveller. But on this occasion her advice was mistaken.\nAfter a while an announcement came through the loudspeakers: there had been a ‘breakdown in the computer system.’ In the face of this setback the atmosphere among the waiting passengers darkened. Some attempted patience, some brave souls even tried to rise to jollity but for the most part the mood became rebellious. They had paid good money – through the nose, many were inclined to feel – for this voyage. This might be their last chance for a bit of luxury. That they could not even be got aboard efficiently did not promise well.\nViolet’s own instinct was to turn tail. She felt in her bag for her phone and discovered that it was missing. This was a good deal more annoying than the length of the queues. It confirmed an uneasy sense that the whole idea of a cruise was one of her mistakes. And now there was the nuisance of the phone. She couldn’t ring the minicab company to check whether she had left it in the taxi, because that number – along with all her other numbers – was stored in her phone. The very error that her elder son Harry was always  counselling her to avoid.\nBehind her in the queue, stood an approachable-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry but, stupidly, I seem to have left my mobile phone behind. I couldn’t borrow yours to make one call, could I?’ Violet rang Harry on the obliging couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbour, if she would check to see whether the phone had been left behind. It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them. Dan might easily forget to give the message to Kristina at all.\nEventually the queues started to move forward and Violet was ushered towards a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to go aboard. Her heart sank further in the ship’s foyer which resembled one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high. There were panels of shining fake walnut, extravagant cascades of chandeliers, polished brass plating and carpets patterned in the style commonly found at airports.\nViolet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’ which were lined floor to ceiling with mirrors and crammed with passengers who, bedraggled from early morning starts, luggage disposal and the incurable anxiety induced by travel arrangements, might have preferred to be spared the sight of their multiple reflections. Violet was squashed against the side of the lift as it moved upward, stopping at each floor to release a tide of thankful prisoners. But, at last, at the twelfth floor, she stepped out to freedom.\nAnd, thank heavens, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been anxiously rehearsing what to say if it had not. Ignoring Annie’s suggestion that she wait for a last minute deal, she had thrown caution to the winds and paid the highest price she could afford in order to be sure of the sea.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) She regretted arriving late at the port.",

While Annie's advice might have been wrong, there's no direct indication that Violet wishes she had listened to her friend.\n   - Option (C) contradicts the passage. Violet feels like the whole idea of the cruise is one of her mistakes, so she wouldn't be glad to be an experienced traveler.\n   - Option (D) aligns well with the text. Violet expresses confusion when she says \"It’s best to get to the docks late,\" indicating she's unsure about which queue to join.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the option that best matches Violet's feeling in the first paragraph is (D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

The queues, by now spilling out of the cattle shed marked ‘Departures’, to board the Queen Caroline where long and none was moving. ‘It’s best to get to the docks late’, her friend Annie had advised. ‘If you get there too early you can grow roots hanging about.’ Annie, married to a diplomat and full of advice, was a seasoned traveller. But on this occasion her advice was mistaken.\nAfter a while an announcement came through the loudspeakers: there had been a ‘breakdown in the computer system.’ In the face of this setback the atmosphere among the waiting passengers darkened. Some attempted patience, some brave souls even tried to rise to jollity but for the most part the mood became rebellious. They had paid good money – through the nose, many were inclined to feel – for this voyage. This might be their last chance for a bit of luxury. That they could not even be got aboard efficiently did not promise well.\nViolet’s own instinct was to turn tail. She felt in her bag for her phone and discovered that it was missing. This was a good deal more annoying than the length of the queues. It confirmed an uneasy sense that the whole idea of a cruise was one of her mistakes. And now there was the nuisance of the phone. She couldn’t ring the minicab company to check whether she had left it in the taxi, because that number – along with all her other numbers – was stored in her phone. The very error that her elder son Harry was always  counselling her to avoid.\nBehind her in the queue, stood an approachable-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry but, stupidly, I seem to have left my mobile phone behind. I couldn’t borrow yours to make one call, could I?’ Violet rang Harry on the obliging couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbour, if she would check to see whether the phone had been left behind. It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them. Dan might easily forget to give the message to Kristina at all.\nEventually the queues started to move forward and Violet was ushered towards a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to go aboard. Her heart sank further in the ship’s foyer which resembled one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high. There were panels of shining fake walnut, extravagant cascades of chandeliers, polished brass plating and carpets patterned in the style commonly found at airports.\nViolet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’ which were lined floor to ceiling with mirrors and crammed with passengers who, bedraggled from early morning starts, luggage disposal and the incurable anxiety induced by travel arrangements, might have preferred to be spared the sight of their multiple reflections. Violet was squashed against the side of the lift as it moved upward, stopping at each floor to release a tide of thankful prisoners. But, at last, at the twelfth floor, she stepped out to freedom.\nAnd, thank heavens, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been anxiously rehearsing what to say if it had not.

        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to focus on the fourth paragraph of the passage. The relevant paragraph is:\n   \"Eventually the queues started to move forward and Violet was ushered towards a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to go aboard. Her heart sank further in the ship's foyer which resembled one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high.\"\n\n2. Now, let's analyze the information given about Violet's attitude towards her sons in this paragraph.\n\n3. The paragraph does not directly mention Violet's attitude towards her sons. Instead, it focuses on Violet's experience at the docks and her reaction to the ship's interior.\n\n4. We need to look for indirect clues or mentions of her sons. However, the paragraph only mentions her sons once, at the end when it states: \"But, at last, at the twelfth floor, she stepped out to freedom. And, thank heavens, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been anxiously rehearsing what to say if it had not. Ignoring Annie's suggestion that she wait for a last minute deal, she had thrown caution to the winds and paid the highest price she could afford in order to be sure of the sea.\"\n\n5. From this, we can infer that Violet was worried about her room having a balcony, indicating a concern for her comfort and possibly her sons' expectations.\n\n6. Looking at the options provided:\n   (A) She wishes she had Harry’s organisational skills.\n   (B) She feels she has a lot in common with Daniel.\n   (C) She believes that Harry has much to learn about life.\n   (D) She thinks Daniel had a tendency to ignore her.\n\n7. None of these options are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the text. However, option (A) is the closest to what we might infer from the context, as Violet seems to be worrying about her trip and possibly her sons' expectations.\n\nGiven the lack of direct information about Violet's attitude towards her sons in the fourth paragraph, and considering the context, the most appropriate answer based on the passage would be:\n\n(A) She wishes she had Harry’s organisational skills.\n\nThis is the closest to what we can reasonably infer from the text, although it is still an assumption rather than a direct statement.",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Here's a breakdown of the passage and the answer:\n\n**Understanding the Context**\n\n* **Violet's Situation:** The passage describes Violet's experience at the Southampton docks trying to board a cruise ship. She's frustrated by the delays, the lost phone, and the overall chaotic situation.\n* **Her Sons:**  The passage focuses on Violet's relationship with her sons, Harry and Daniel. \n* **Harry's Perspective:**  The text states that Harry believes he is \"older than his mother\" and \"more worldly wise.\" He's likely more practical and less prone to emotional reactions.\n* **Daniel's Perspective:**  The text says Daniel is \"far more sympathetic to her faults\" because they share them. This suggests a closer, more understanding relationship.\n\n**Analyzing the Fourth Paragraph**\n\nThe fourth paragraph focuses on Violet's thoughts about her sons and their relationship with her. \n\n* **\"Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise.\"** This sentence tells us that Harry has a more mature and practical outlook on life than Violet.\n* **\"Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them.\"** This sentence highlights the bond between Violet and Daniel. They likely have a deeper understanding of each other's struggles.\n\n**Answer**\n\nThe correct answer is **(C) She believes that Harry has much to learn about life.** \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe passage explicitly states that Harry is \"more worldly wise\" than his mother.

It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them. Dan might easily forget to give the message to Kristina at all.\"\n\nFrom this passage, we can infer the following about Violet's attitude towards her sons:\n\n- Violet does not confide her worries about the missing phone to Harry, indicating that she does not fully trust him or feel comfortable sharing her concerns with him.\n- Daniel, on the other hand, is described as being more sympathetic to her faults because he shares them, suggesting that Violet feels a closer connection or understanding with Daniel.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate option is:\n(B) She feels she has a lot in common with Daniel."

The context is about her realizing that she has left her phone behind, which includes all her important numbers, such as the minicab company's number. This situation is causing her distress because she cannot easily find these numbers in New York, where she is going.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) uncertainty about where she had left the phone\n\nThis option is the most accurate because it directly relates to the phone and the numbers stored in it, which Violet is concerned about losing and not being able to access.

She is frustrated because she cannot find her phone, which contained all her contact information.\n\n2. **Locate the Specific Sentence**: We need to find the sentence containing \"This was a good deal more annoying than the length of the queues.\" This sentence is in line 23 of the given text.\n\n3. **Analyze the Sentence**: The sentence states that the missing phone is more annoying than the long queues. This implies that losing the phone is causing Violet significant inconvenience.\n\n4. **Examine the Options**:\n   - (A) **a relief that she wouldn’t be able to contact people in New York**: This option suggests that losing the phone would be a positive outcome, which contradicts the context.\n   - (B) **frustration at having lost the telephone numbers**: This option aligns with the context as losing the phone means she can't contact anyone, including her son Harry, which is indeed frustrating.\n   - (C) **fear that her son would be angry with her**: There's no indication in the passage that Violet fears her son's anger.\n   - (D) **uncertainty about where she had left the phone**: While this is a concern, the passage indicates that she has already determined the phone is missing, so this isn't the primary issue.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (B) frustration at having lost the telephone numbers.

The word \"sink\" and the negative description of the foyer are strong indicators of her feeling of disappointment.\n\n**Therefore, the best answer is (C) nervousness in strange unfamiliar surroundings.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **(A) Disbelief that they were actually on a ship:**  While she might have felt disbelief at the delays and the state of the ship, the passage focuses more on her emotional response to the environment.\n* **(B) Surprise at the spaciousness of the ship’s interior:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the ship's interior being spacious.\n* **(D) Disappointment at the style of the decoration:** The passage focuses on the negative aspects of the foyer's style, but it doesn't suggest disappointment in the overall style. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other reading comprehension questions! \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Context and Setting**: The passage describes Violet Hetherington's experience at Southampton docks, waiting for a cruise ship named the Queen Caroline. She has missed her scheduled departure due to a computer breakdown and is now trying to board the ship.\n\n2. **Violet's Initial Reaction**: Violet initially feels \"incredulous\" (\"What on earth have I done?\") when realizing she missed her cruise. She then expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with the situation, including the inconvenience of missing her phone and the poor service at the docks.\n\n3. **Boarding Process**: After a series of mishaps, Violet finally boards the ship. The passage describes the ship's foyer in detail:\n   - It mentions that the foyer resembles \"one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high.\"\n   - It describes the interior as having \"panels of shining fake walnut,\" \"extravagant cascades of chandeliers,\" \"polished brass plating,\" and \"carpets patterned in the style commonly found at airports.\"\n\n4. **Implication Analysis**: The reference passage provides clues about Violet's feelings as she navigates the ship's foyer. The comparison to a \"not-so-grand hotel that has set its sights too high\" suggests that the interior is grander or more opulent than expected, which typically evokes a sense of surprise or perhaps a mix of emotions.\n\n5. **Matching Options**:\n   - Option (A): Disbelief that they were actually on a ship is less likely because the passage does not indicate Violet was surprised at the presence of the ship.\n   - Option (B): Surprise at the spaciousness of the ship’s interior aligns well with the description of the foyer. The comparison to a grand hotel suggests Violet feels surprised at the grandeur and space.\n   - Option (C): Nervousness in strange unfamiliar surroundings is inconsistent with the overall tone of the passage. Violet seems resigned to her situation rather than nervous.\n   - Option (D): Disappointment at the style of the decoration is also inconsistent with the passage. While Violet is disappointed by the missed phone, the passage does not suggest disappointment with the decor itself.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(B) Surprise at the spaciousness of the ship’s interior\n\nTherefore, Violet felt surprise at the spaciousness of the ship’s interior.",

The queues, by now spilling out of the cattle shed marked ‘Departures’, to board the Queen Caroline where long and none was moving. ‘It’s best to get to the docks late’, her friend Annie had advised. ‘If you get there too early you can grow roots hanging about.’ Annie, married to a diplomat and full of advice, was a seasoned traveller. But on this occasion her advice was mistaken.\nAfter a while an announcement came through the loudspeakers: there had been a ‘breakdown in the computer system.’ In the face of this setback the atmosphere among the waiting passengers darkened. Some attempted patience, some brave souls even tried to rise to jollity but for the most part the mood became rebellious. They had paid good money – through the nose, many were inclined to feel – for this voyage. This might be their last chance for a bit of luxury. That they could not even be got aboard efficiently did not promise well.\nViolet’s own instinct was to turn tail. She felt in her bag for her phone and discovered that it was missing. This was a good deal more annoying than the length of the queues. It confirmed an uneasy sense that the whole idea of a cruise was one of her mistakes. And now there was the nuisance of the phone. She couldn’t ring the minicab company to check whether she had left it in the taxi, because that number – along with all her other numbers – was stored in her phone. The very error that her elder son Harry was always  counselling her to avoid.\nBehind her in the queue, stood an approachable-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry but, stupidly, I seem to have left my mobile phone behind. I couldn’t borrow yours to make one call, could I?’ Violet rang Harry on the obliging couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbour, if she would check to see whether the phone had been left behind. It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them. Dan might easily forget to give the message to Kristina at all.\nEventually the queues started to move forward and Violet was ushered towards a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to go aboard. Her heart sank further in the ship’s foyer which resembled one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high. There were panels of shining fake walnut, extravagant cascades of chandeliers, polished brass plating and carpets patterned in the style commonly found at airports.\nViolet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’ which were lined floor to ceiling with mirrors and crammed with passengers who, bedraggled from early morning starts, luggage disposal and the incurable anxiety induced by travel arrangements, might have preferred to be spared the sight of their multiple reflections. Violet was squashed against the side of the lift as it moved upward, stopping at each floor to release a tide of thankful prisoners. But, at last, at the twelfth floor, she stepped out to freedom.\nAnd, thank heavens, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been anxiously rehearsing what to say if it had not. Ignoring Annie’s suggestion that she wait for a last minute deal, she had thrown caution to the winds and paid the highest price she could afford in order to be sure of the sea.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) She had been afraid that her room would be unsatisfactory.",

        "processed_text": "Why was Alice not satisfied when she took her students to a famous ancient wall?\nOptions:\n(A) She wished she’d prepared them better for the visit.\n(B) She could sense they were getting rather bored.\n(C) She realised they were regretting their decision.\n(D) She felt something was missing from her explanations. \nReference Passage: Alice Leader was standing in front of the remains of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an extraordinary feat of engineering it was by the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 metres high back around 1900 years ago. She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she’d taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn’t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I’m still in touch with children through the fiction.’\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s fiction for children. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she is quick to add, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is spurred on by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It’s all down to me to make it work at that point.’\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was finally inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the seeds lay in the prospect of the ‘empty nest’ approaching as her two sons were leaving home, and an unexpected recommendation from her head teacher that she would enjoy a residential creative writing course. Alice was taken aback. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn’t think was necessary.’\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analysed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his assistance in editing the novel was key. Says Alice, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene. That’s  the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) She felt something was missing from her explanations.

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer the reading comprehension question, let's carefully analyze the reference passage and the question.\n\n### Context and Core of the Question\nThe question asks us to identify why Alice was not satisfied when she took her students to a famous ancient wall. We need to look at the passage to understand her situation and feelings.\n\n### Analysis of the Reference Passage\n1. **Setting and Introduction**: The passage describes Alice leading a class of 12- and 13-year-olds to Hadrian's Wall in Britain. The students chose this trip over more glamorous destinations like Spain, Greece, or France.\n2. **Students' Interest**: The group was already engaged by the site, which indicates some level of interest.\n3. **Questioning the Purpose**: However, the students were curious about the purpose of building Hadrian's Wall, indicating they were seeking more context or explanation.\n4. **Alice's Feelings**: The passage states, \"When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself.\" This shows that Alice felt her current explanations were unsatisfactory.\n5. **Resolution**: Alice decided to write a historical novel to address the students' curiosity and provide more context and human interest to the topic.\n\n### Connecting to the Question\nGiven the information, the crucial point is that Alice felt her existing explanations were insufficient to satisfy her students. Her attempt to find a historical novel to enhance the experience was unsuccessful, leading her to decide to write her own novel. This indicates dissatisfaction with her current methods of explaining the subject.\n\n### Answering the Question\nConsidering the options provided:\n\n- (A) She wished she'd prepared them better for the visit.\n- (B) She could sense they were getting rather bored.\n- (C) She realised they were regretting their decision.\n- (D) She felt something was missing from her explanations.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the passage where Alice explicitly mentions feeling unsatisfied with her explanations (\"When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest...\").\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B: She could sense they were getting rather bored.**\n\nWhile boredom might have contributed to her feeling unsatisfied, the primary reason given in the passage is her inability to find suitable context and human interest in her current explanations. Thus, option (B) is the closest match to the information provided.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. Alice was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall, trying to explain its significance to her students.\n2. She felt her answers were unsatisfactory because the students wanted to know why the Wall was built.\n3. Alice couldn't find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to the story of life at the Wall in Roman times.\n4. She decided to write a novel herself to fill this gap.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\n(A) She wished she’d prepared them better for the visit.\n- The passage does not mention anything about Alice wishing she had prepared them better for the visit. The focus is on the students' lack of understanding and interest.\n\n(B) She could sense they were getting rather bored.\n- The passage does not indicate that the students were bored. Instead, it suggests that they were interested but not fully understanding the historical context.\n\n(C) She realised they were regretting their decision.\n- The passage does not mention the students regretting their decision to visit Hadrian’s Wall. It focuses on Alice's realization that her explanations were unsatisfactory.\n\n(D) She felt something was missing from her explanations.\n- This option aligns with the passage, as Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory and couldn't find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to the story.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answer is (D) She felt something was missing from her explanations. Alice was not satisfied because she realized that her explanations lacked the historical context and human interest that would make the story of Hadrian’s Wall more engaging and understandable for her students."

She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she’d taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn’t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I’m still in touch with children through the fiction.’\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s fiction for children. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she is quick to add, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is spurred on by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It’s all down to me to make it work at that point.’\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was finally inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the seeds lay in the prospect of the ‘empty nest’ approaching as her two sons were leaving home, and an unexpected recommendation from her head teacher that she would enjoy a residential creative writing course. Alice was taken aback. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn’t think was necessary.’\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analysed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his assistance in editing the novel was key. Says Alice, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene.

The head teacher also recommended that she take a creative writing course, which further encouraged her to pursue writing.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) Alice knows she must learn from other successful novelists.\n- This is not directly supported by the passage. There's no mention of Alice learning from successful novelists.\n\n(B) Alice knows she needs to find an identity as a writer.\n- While the passage indicates Alice is considering writing and taking up a new career, it does not suggest she specifically needs to find an identity as a writer.\n\n(C) Alice is keen to avoid offending other novelists.\n- There is no information in the passage about Alice wanting to avoid offending other novelists.\n\n(D) Alice is trying to get more imagination into her writing.\n- The passage doesn't mention anything about Alice trying to get more imagination into her writing. Instead, it talks about her starting to think about writing and the encouragement she received from her head teacher.\n\nThe most accurate suggestion based on the passage is that Alice was thinking about writing because of the \"empty nest\" situation and the encouragement from her head teacher. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (B): Alice knows she needs to find an identity as a writer.",

She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she’d taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn’t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I’m still in touch with children through the fiction.’\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s fiction for children. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she is quick to add, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is spurred on by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It’s all down to me to make it work at that point.’\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was finally inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the seeds lay in the prospect of the ‘empty nest’ approaching as her two sons were leaving home, and an unexpected recommendation from her head teacher that she would enjoy a residential creative writing course. Alice was taken aback. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn’t think was necessary.’\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analysed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his assistance in editing the novel was key.

He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working he suggests changing the words.

She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she’d taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn’t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I’m still in touch with children through the fiction.’\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s fiction for children. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she is quick to add, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is spurred on by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It’s all down to me to make it work at that point.’\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was finally inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the seeds lay in the prospect of the ‘empty nest’ approaching as her two sons were leaving home, and an unexpected recommendation from her head teacher that she would enjoy a residential creative writing course. Alice was taken aback. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn’t think was necessary.’\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately.

With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his assistance in editing the novel was key. Says Alice, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene.

In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car – and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No?

In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow.

        "Phi35MiniInst_answer": "In line 9, the term 'denting' is used in the context of Alistair's confidence. The phrase \"not that the cold was denting his confidence\" implies that the cold weather was not diminishing or affecting Alistair's self-assurance or belief in his ability to complete the race. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) underestimating\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the term 'denting' in this context is more accurately interpreted as not affecting or diminishing his confidence, rather than underestimating it. The closest option provided is (C) underestimating, but the intended meaning is more along the lines of not being affected. The CEFR level mentioned does not directly influence the interpretation of the term in this context.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the context**: The sentence containing \"denting\" is: \"To be honest,\" he said, \"I've seen his driving before, so I'm not sure he's even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.\" The phrase \"denting his confidence\" appears in the reference passage.\n\n2. **Locate the exact sentence**: The sentence we need to analyze is: \"Not that the cold was denting his confidence.\"\n\n3. **Understand the meaning of 'dent'**:\n   - The verb \"to dent\" typically means to cause a small indentation or damage to something.\n   - It can also metaphorically mean to weaken or reduce the strength or effect of something.\n\n4. **Analyze the context**:\n   - In this case, the cold weather (\"the cold\") is being described as having an impact on \"his confidence\" (\"denting his confidence\").\n   - The sentence suggests that despite the cold, Alistair remains confident.\n\n5. **Interpret the phrase**:\n   - If the cold were \"denting\" his confidence, it would imply that the cold was somehow weakening or reducing his confidence.\n   - However, the sentence implies that the cold is not significantly affecting his confidence, as he still believes he will win.\n\n6. **Match the interpretation to the options**:\n   - (A) causing: This fits well because the cold is causing a reduction in his confidence.\n   - (B) controlling: This doesn't fit as well because the cold isn't controlling his confidence.\n   - (C) underestimating: This doesn't fit because the cold isn't leading to an underestimation of his own abilities.\n   - (D) reducing: While similar to \"causing,\" \"reducing\" is slightly less precise in this context.\n\nGiven these steps, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**(A) causing**\n\nTherefore, \"denting\" in this context means \"causing\" a reduction in his confidence.",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Here's how to break down the meaning of \"denting\" in line 9:\n\n**1. Context:**\n\n* The passage is about a race between two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee.\n* Alistair is confident he can beat Jonny, even though Jonny is driving a car.\n* Alistair is prepared for the challenges of the race, including a steep incline.\n\n**2. The Sentence:**\n\n* \"Not that the cold was **denting** his confidence.\"\n\n**3. Understanding \"Denting\":**\n\n* **Meaning:**  \"Denting\" in this context means **weakening or diminishing** someone's confidence. \n* **Why it fits:**  The sentence implies that Alistair's confidence is not being significantly affected by the cold. He's not letting it discourage him.\n\n**4.  The Answer:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(A) causing**. \n\n**Explanation:**  The sentence is saying that the cold is not making Alistair doubt his ability to win. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer the question about the meaning of 'denting' in line 9, we need to carefully analyze the context provided in the passage.\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant line:\n\"Not that the cold was denting his confidence.\"\n\nNext, let's break down the sentence structure:\n- \"Not that\" introduces a contrast or exception.\n- \"the cold\" is the subject of the sentence.\n- \"was denting\" is the main verb phrase, where \"denting\" is the action being performed by the cold.\n- \"his confidence\" is the object, indicating what the cold is affecting.\n\nGiven the reference passage, we can infer that Alistair is talking about his feelings towards the cold weather and his confidence in the upcoming race. The word \"dentine\" means to weaken, damage, or affect adversely. So, \"dentin\" in this context means to reduce or diminish something.\n\nTherefore, in line 9, \"dentin\" means to reduce or diminish. This fits option (D) \"reducing.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(D) reducing",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To determine what 'denting' means in line 9, let's break down the context and the surrounding text.\n\n1. **Context of the Passage**: The passage describes a race between Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, where Jonny drives a car and Alistair rides a mountain bike across challenging terrain. The race involves various obstacles, including steep inclines, narrow roads, and streams.\n\n2. **Line 9**: \"Clear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.

The phrase \"squeal of brakes as he reached the line\" indicates that Jonny had to slow down abruptly to stop at the finish line. This slowing down or loss of speed is what 'denting' means in this context.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - (A) causing: This does not fit the context of losing speed.\n   - (B) controlling: This does not fit the context of losing speed.\n   - (C) underestimating: This does not fit the context of losing speed.\n   - (D) reducing: This fits the context of losing speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) reducing."

Jonny is focused on his car and the road ahead, while Alistair is concentrated on his mountain bike and the challenging terrain. There is no explicit mention of them avoiding eye contact, but their separate focuses and the physical distance between them during the race suggest a lack of direct interaction, which could be interpreted as avoiding eye contact.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the start of the race:\n(A) The brothers' uncertainty about the route is not mentioned.\n(B) Alistair's training is not discussed.\n(C) Jonny having a noticeable advantage is not suggested, as the passage indicates both brothers face challenges.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's analyze the reference passage step by step to determine what is suggested about the start of the race:\n\n1. **Context and Setting**: The passage describes a unique race between brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, where Jonny will race in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike.\n\n2. **Start Line Preparation**:\n   - \"The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up.\"\n   - \"No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start.\"\n\n3. **Brothers' Attitudes**:\n   - Jonny: \"I’m looking forward to it,\" \"I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.\"\n   - Alistair: \"To be honest,\" he said, “I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.”\n\n4. **Initial Observations**:\n   - Jonny's initial confidence seems high, but he faces his first obstacle immediately.\n   - Alistair starts with a disadvantage due to the steep incline.\n\n5. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - (A) The brothers appeared very uncertain of the route: This is not supported by the passage. Both brothers seem confident and prepared.\n   - (B) Alistair’s training had been insufficient: There is no mention of Alistair's training level in the passage.\n   - (C) Jonny had a noticeable advantage: While Jonny seems more confident initially, the passage does not suggest he has a noticeable advantage over Alistair.\n   - (D) The brothers tried to avoid eye contact with each other: The passage does not mention any avoidance of eye contact.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Based on the analysis, the option most supported by the passage is (D) The brothers tried to avoid eye contact with each other. However, since the passage explicitly states they had a quick handshake and did not mention avoiding eye contact, we should re-evaluate the options carefully.\n\nGiven the context and the specific details provided, none of the options perfectly match the information given in the passage. But if we must choose the closest one based on the provided information:\n\nThe best answer is (D) The brothers tried to avoid eye contact with each other.

He's described as an Olympic champion.\n* **(C) Jonny had a noticeable advantage.** The passage states Jonny's early confidence was shaken by a tractor, and Alistair was struggling with the incline. This suggests a potential advantage for Alistair.\n* **(D) The brothers tried to avoid eye contact with each other.** The passage doesn't mention any attempts to avoid eye contact.\n\n**The Answer**\n\nThe most accurate answer is **(C) Jonny had a noticeable advantage.**  \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe passage highlights Alistair's early struggles with the incline and the fact that he had to carry his bike up a hill. This suggests that Jonny, in his car, had an easier start and was initially in a better position. \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "Let's analyze the passage step-by-step to determine what is suggested about the start of the race:\n\n1. **Identify the key information about the start**: The passage mentions that \"The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up.\"\n\n2. **Examine the brothers' reactions and actions at the start**:\n   - Jonny (older brother) says, \"I’m looking forward to it... It’s exciting!\"\n   - Jonny mentions, \"These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.\"\n   - Jonny complains about the tractor, saying, \"Welcome to Yorkshire. If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!\"\n\n3. **Analyze the race conditions at the start**:\n   - Jonny starts in a car, facing immediate challenges such as a tractor blocking the road and negotiating a narrow corner.\n   - Alistair (younger brother) starts on a mountain bike, facing steep inclines and carrying his bike up hills.\n\n4. **Consider the given options**:\n   (A) The brothers appeared very uncertain of the route.\n   (B) Alistair’s training had been insufficient.\n   (C) Jonny had a noticeable advantage.\n   (D) The brothers tried to avoid eye contact with each other.\n\nBased on the passage, we can conclude:\n\n- The brothers were both enthusiastic about the race, showing no signs of being uncertain or avoiding eye contact. So options (A) and (D) can be ruled out.\n- There is no indication in the passage that Alistair had inadequate training, making option (B) unlikely.\n- While Jonny starts in a car which might give him an initial advantage due to his ability to drive, the passage suggests that Jonny faces significant challenges immediately after starting, such as the tractor and the narrow corner. This indicates that Jonny does not have a noticeable advantage right from the start.\n\nTherefore, the best answer based on the passage is:\n\n(C) Jonny had a noticeable advantage.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the start of the race, Jonny does not appear to have a noticeable advantage right from the start. The correct answer among the given options should be:\n\nNone of the provided options accurately reflect the situation described in the passage regarding the start of the race. The passage suggests that the start was challenging for both brothers.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question about what is suggested about the start of the race, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the start of the race, where Jonny and Alistair Brownlee brothers are racing in a unique event. Jonny is in a car, and Alistair is on a mountain bike.\n\n2. Jonny expresses excitement and looks forward to the race, mentioning the beautiful views and the cold weather, which he will be able to enjoy in the car. This suggests that he is confident and looking forward to the race.\n\n3. Alistair, on the other hand, is dressed in full winter cycling gear and expresses a lack of confidence, saying he might stop for a cup of tea halfway up the hill. This suggests that he is not as confident as Jonny.\n\n4. The passage then describes the start of the race, with Alistair sprinting away on his bike and Jonny getting into the car. Alistair faces a steep incline, while Jonny encounters a tractor in the road.\n\n5. Alistair continues to struggle with the slope, dismounting and carrying his bike up the hill, while Jonny faces another local obstacle, a narrow corner and a stream.\n\n6. The passage ends with Alistair approaching the finish line from the other side, while Jonny is racing through the final straight to Fleet Moss. Alistair reaches the finish line first, and Jonny expresses disappointment.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (C) Jonny had a noticeable advantage. This is because Alistair faced significant challenges, such as the steep incline and carrying his bike up the hill, while Jonny encountered obstacles like the tractor and narrow corner, but still managed to reach the finish line. Alistair's early confidence and determination, as well as his ability to overcome the challenges, suggest that he had a noticeable advantage in the race."

In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it.

No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car – and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No?

To understand the meaning, let's look at the context surrounding 'coasting'.

This implies he believes Jonny might not complete the race.\n   - The second quote indicates that Alistair finds it difficult to keep up with Jonny's pace, which seems to be due to Jonny relaxing after starting the race.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on these quotes, it is clear that Alistair sees Jonny's initial advantage as temporary and believes he has a good chance of catching up. He does not seem resentful or distracted by Jonny's behavior; rather, he remains focused and hopeful of winning.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(C) He welcomed an opportunity to prove his ability.\n\nThis option aligns best with Alistair's attitude and actions described in the passage, especially the statement \"To be honest, I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it.

In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car – and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ The head went back, the arms up. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car pulled up and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said with disappointment. ‘I’m gutted.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) puzzled",

Jonny faces his first obstacle at the start, which is described as a \"giant tractor lumbering out of a field and onto the road,\" indicating a tight space issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question about Jonny’s progress in the sixth paragraph, let's break down the relevant part of the passage:\n\n\"Clear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No?

In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car – and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ The head went back, the arms up. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car pulled up and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said with disappointment. ‘I’m gutted.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) He was uncertain who the winner was.",

        "processed_text": "What does the writer suggest about his decision to throw his electric guitar away?\nOptions:\n(A) He still cannot explain it.\n(B) He blames it on his inexperience.\n(C) His father was unhappy with it.\n(D) He was persuaded by a stranger to do it.\nReference Passage: Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways.\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That’s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn’t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears. I think I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was very fair. I’d forgotten all about my dad’s annoying habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. How Dad would have laughed to hear about this strange series of events!\nMy mum and dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar: it was the 1970s and classical guitarists were very popular. I loved the sound of the instrument: so calming, so gentle – and so flattering to the learner. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound awful in the hands of a beginner. But the truth was, I couldn’t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. This was not just the era of the classical guitar; it was also the time of punk music, when people who  weren’t able to play their instruments well could be rock stars.\nWhen I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith had sent to me, I had a sudden, vivid memory of my birthday, back in 1978, when my smiling parents presented the instrument to me. Picking it up again, it felt so fascinatingly smooth, dense, yet smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then instantly felt the need to stand up, putting a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar demands to be played in this position. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it. My middle-aged, fleshy fingertips felt that special pain of holding down the wires to play a chord.\nThe electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I guess I’ll have to form a band. My son’s learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves \n‘The Regainers’!\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) He still cannot explain it.",

However, he felt compelled to throw away the guitar, implying it was not a particularly important item to him at the time.\n* **The Encounter with the Young Man:** The encounter with the young man at the dump was a turning point. He was baffled by the writer's decision and the writer felt a sense of regret. This suggests the young man's reaction was a catalyst for the writer to reconsider his decision.\n* **The Writer's Past:** The passage mentions the writer's father's preference for classical guitar and his own struggles with learning it. This suggests the writer may have felt pressured to learn classical guitar, which he didn't enjoy. The switch to the electric guitar might have been a way to express his own musical preferences.\n\n**The passage does not explicitly state the writer's reasons for throwing away the guitar, but it strongly suggests:**\n\n* **He was not actively using the guitar.** The passage mentions he was \"moving house\" and \"having a clear-out,\" implying a general decluttering process.\n* **He was influenced by the young man's reaction.** The young man's surprise and the writer's subsequent regret suggest the decision was not a conscious one.\n* **He may have been influenced by his father's preference for classical guitar.** The passage mentions his father's influence and the writer's own struggles with classical guitar.\n\n\n**Therefore, the best answer is (A) He still cannot explain it.** \n\nThe passage doesn't provide a clear explanation for the writer's decision.

Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways.\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That’s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn’t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears. I think I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was very fair.

This regret leads to a chain of events that ultimately brings him back to the guitar. \n* **The story highlights the idea that life can take unexpected turns.** The guitar's journey from the dump to the hands of a stranger and then back to the author is a prime example of this. \n* **The author's emotional journey emphasizes the impact of small choices and their potential for significant consequences.** The story is not about the guitar itself, but about the emotional impact of the author's actions and the unexpected events that follow.\n\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **(B) poor his memory had become.**  The passage doesn't mention any issues with the author's memory.\n* **(C) unhappy losing his guitar had made him.** The story doesn't suggest that losing the guitar caused unhappiness.

We should look for clues within the passage about the emotional or thematic focus of the narrative.\n\n2. **Analyze the Passage:**\n   - The writer talks about finding an electric guitar that they had discarded many years ago.\n   - A young man named Keith, who found the guitar, offered to buy it back from the writer.\n   - The writer initially felt regret for throwing away the guitar but then felt a sense of relief and happiness upon receiving it back.\n\n3. **Contextual Clues:**\n   - The writer describes a strong emotional attachment to the guitar, as evidenced by the vivid memories of its presentation on their 16th birthday and the nostalgic feelings they experienced upon handling it again.\n   - The story illustrates a significant emotional journey of rediscovery and reconnection with a cherished possession.\n\n4. **Match the Theme to the Options:**\n   - **Option (A): Easy it is to make big mistakes in life.** This option does not align with the passage. The story does not discuss making big mistakes or regrets.\n   - **Option (B): Poor his memory had become.** This is incorrect as the passage does not mention anything about the writer's memory failing.\n   - **Option (C): Unhappy losing his guitar had made him.** This is partially true but does not fully capture the main emphasis of the passage. The writer felt relief rather than unhappiness.\n   - **Option (D): Strange coincidences can be.** This seems plausible as the story itself is a surprising coincidence where the writer unexpectedly gets their guitar back after many years.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage emphasizes how surprising and delightful it can be to find something one had thought long lost, which resonates with the idea of strange coincidences. \n\n### Final Answer:\nThe writer tells the story of the man and his wedding ring to emphasize how **(D) strange coincidences can be.**",

Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways.\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That’s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn’t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears. I think I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was very fair. I’d forgotten all about my dad’s annoying habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. How Dad would have laughed to hear about this strange series of events!\nMy mum and dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar: it was the 1970s and classical guitarists were very popular. I loved the sound of the instrument: so calming, so gentle – and so flattering to the learner. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound awful in the hands of a beginner. But the truth was, I couldn’t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. This was not just the era of the classical guitar; it was also the time of punk music, when people who  weren’t able to play their instruments well could be rock stars.\nWhen I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith had sent to me, I had a sudden, vivid memory of my birthday, back in 1978, when my smiling parents presented the instrument to me. Picking it up again, it felt so fascinatingly smooth, dense, yet smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then instantly felt the need to stand up, putting a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar demands to be played in this position. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it.

        "processed_text": "What does ‘similar experience’ refer to in line 73?\nOptions:\n(A) setting up a band\n(B) relearning the guitar\n(C) finding a lost instrument\n(D) playing music with the family\nReference Passage: Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways.\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That’s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn’t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears. I think I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was very fair. I’d forgotten all about my dad’s annoying habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. How Dad would have laughed to hear about this strange series of events!\nMy mum and dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar: it was the 1970s and classical guitarists were very popular. I loved the sound of the instrument: so calming, so gentle – and so flattering to the learner. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound awful in the hands of a beginner. But the truth was, I couldn’t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. This was not just the era of the classical guitar; it was also the time of punk music, when people who  weren’t able to play their instruments well could be rock stars.\nWhen I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith had sent to me, I had a sudden, vivid memory of my birthday, back in 1978, when my smiling parents presented the instrument to me. Picking it up again, it felt so fascinatingly smooth, dense, yet smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then instantly felt the need to stand up, putting a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar demands to be played in this position. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it. My middle-aged, fleshy fingertips felt that special pain of holding down the wires to play a chord.\nThe electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I guess I’ll have to form a band. My son’s learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves \n‘The Regainers’!\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) finding a lost instrument",

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this question, let's carefully analyze the reference passage:\n\n1. The passage discusses the author's past experience with an electric guitar, which they gave away twenty years ago.\n2. The key point in line 73 is when the author says, \"Maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine.\"\n3. This sentence is part of a discussion about forming a band and playing music again.\n\nGiven these points, the phrase \"similar experience\" refers to the experience of learning and playing the electric guitar as described in the passage. Specifically, it relates to the author's journey of starting to play the guitar, finding enjoyment in it despite not being very good at it, and eventually giving up the instrument due to lack of progress.\n\nThus, the correct option is (D) playing music with the family.\n\nOption (D) is the most fitting as the author is suggesting that others who share a similar background and experience might find themselves in the same situation of having given up on the guitar and now wanting to pick it up again. Playing music with the family fits well here as a common activity that many people engage in, especially during childhood or youth.",

The narrator mentions that the guitar was a gift from their parents and that they had a strong emotional connection to it.\n3. The narrator describes the joy and familiarity they felt when they picked up the guitar again.\n4. The narrator reflects on the guitar's role in their life and the music they played with it.\n5. The narrator considers forming a band with their son, who is learning the saxophone, and wonders if there are others of their age who have had a similar experience.\n\nGiven this context, the 'similar experience' in line 73 likely refers to the emotional and musical connection the narrator had with the guitar, which they are now rediscovering. This experience is not about setting up a band, relearning the guitar, finding a lost instrument, or playing music with the family, but rather the personal and nostalgic feelings associated with the guitar and the music it represents.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting option is not explicitly listed, but based on the context, the closest option would be:\n\n(D) playing music with the family\n\nThis option aligns with the narrator's reflection on the guitar's role in their life and the music they played, which is a part of their family experience.

It was her great obsession from childhood. With the boats that took her round the world, she had a kind of strange union. They worked as one. And when she was on land again, everyday life felt trivial, everyone pressed in too much to find out about the race, and she soon wanted to be out on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature even in places that had nearly destroyed her.\nAfter she came second in the Vendée Globe non stop, solo round-the-world race several years ago, she took me down into the tiny, unventilated cabin of her boat Kingfisher on a ‘tour’ of what had been her cell, home, work station and survival-capsule for 94 days. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning; how she worked out, to the last sheet, exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was everything, she said. Proudly, she showed off her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, the tiny gas stove, the neatly hanging polythene bags of medical necessities and rations. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. \nNow, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, a desolate island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space … to see things differently; to realise things I hadn’t let into my head before.’ The sight of so many abandoned whaling stations struck her as a warning. ‘It seemed as though we had just taken what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.’\nWhen I arrive at Ellen’s office she is just finishing off a heated conference call. Then she explains to me why action must be taken now to save the planet. ‘No one is making coal or oil or gas any more. They are a precious asset we have just once. We have to design a way of not using things up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but gradually I realised there was another way of looking at things.’ Now she emphasises re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.\n For the last three years, she has been touring factories, mines and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she says. ‘But I am a bit like a sponge. I love soaking things up. [The current situation] became something I just couldn’t ignore. Sailing, by comparison, seemed incredibly selfish. This is different. It’s about trying to find out how my voice can be the most useful. It really matters.’\nShe also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure that comes from being at sea,’ she says. ‘It is what makes me, me. You are so connected to everything around you. You have no time to get lonely. You are focused on the record, on practicalities, on survival. [My new] message will never be as straightforward as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest person round the world.” I may have been the fastest round the world, but this beats everything I’ve ever done.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) be overwhelmed by all the people wanting to talk to her.",

It was her great obsession from childhood. With the boats that took her round the world, she had a kind of strange union. They worked as one. And when she was on land again, everyday life felt trivial, everyone pressed in too much to find out about the race, and she soon wanted to be out on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature even in places that had nearly destroyed her.\nAfter she came second in the Vendée Globe non stop, solo round-the-world race several years ago, she took me down into the tiny, unventilated cabin of her boat Kingfisher on a ‘tour’ of what had been her cell, home, work station and survival-capsule for 94 days. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning; how she worked out, to the last sheet, exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was everything, she said. Proudly, she showed off her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, the tiny gas stove, the neatly hanging polythene bags of medical necessities and rations. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. \nNow, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, a desolate island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space … to see things differently; to realise things I hadn’t let into my head before.’ The sight of so many abandoned whaling stations struck her as a warning. ‘It seemed as though we had just taken what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.’\nWhen I arrive at Ellen’s office she is just finishing off a heated conference call. Then she explains to me why action must be taken now to save the planet. ‘No one is making coal or oil or gas any more. They are a precious asset we have just once. We have to design a way of not using things up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but gradually I realised there was another way of looking at things.’ Now she emphasises re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.\n For the last three years, she has been touring factories, mines and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she says. ‘But I am a bit like a sponge. I love soaking things up. [The current situation] became something I just couldn’t ignore. Sailing, by comparison, seemed incredibly selfish. This is different. It’s about trying to find out how my voice can be the most useful. It really matters.’\nShe also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure that comes from being at sea,’ she says. ‘It is what makes me, me. You are so connected to everything around you. You have no time to get lonely. You are focused on the record, on practicalities, on survival. [My new] message will never be as straightforward as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest person round the world.” I may have been the fastest round the world, but this beats everything I’ve ever done.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) gained satisfaction from making sure she had everything she needed.",

It was her great obsession from childhood. With the boats that took her round the world, she had a kind of strange union. They worked as one. And when she was on land again, everyday life felt trivial, everyone pressed in too much to find out about the race, and she soon wanted to be out on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature even in places that had nearly destroyed her.\nAfter she came second in the Vendée Globe non stop, solo round-the-world race several years ago, she took me down into the tiny, unventilated cabin of her boat Kingfisher on a ‘tour’ of what had been her cell, home, work station and survival-capsule for 94 days. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning; how she worked out, to the last sheet, exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was everything, she said. Proudly, she showed off her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, the tiny gas stove, the neatly hanging polythene bags of medical necessities and rations. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. \nNow, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, a desolate island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space … to see things differently; to realise things I hadn’t let into my head before.’ The sight of so many abandoned whaling stations struck her as a warning. ‘It seemed as though we had just taken what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.’\nWhen I arrive at Ellen’s office she is just finishing off a heated conference call. Then she explains to me why action must be taken now to save the planet. ‘No one is making coal or oil or gas any more. They are a precious asset we have just once. We have to design a way of not using things up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but gradually I realised there was another way of looking at things.’ Now she emphasises re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.\n For the last three years, she has been touring factories, mines and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she says. ‘But I am a bit like a sponge. I love soaking things up. [The current situation] became something I just couldn’t ignore. Sailing, by comparison, seemed incredibly selfish. This is different. It’s about trying to find out how my voice can be the most useful. It really matters.’\nShe also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure that comes from being at sea,’ she says. ‘It is what makes me, me.

Most of us can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and you can tell by the expression on their face that they haven’t a clue.  I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age.  And if you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work.\nThe statistics must be depressing for a lover of classical music.  Apparently only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere 300 copies.  I must say I still find that hard to believe.  So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries?  The older generation are irritated by our obsession with TV and video games, blaming it for most things, but I don’t think there is any connection in this case.  The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets.\nNow, I’m aware that this doesn’t apply to everyone my age.  I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts all the time, but they are a minority.  Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not exactly a classical music fan.  I enjoy a huge range of styles, but judging by what’s stored on my computer, my classical music consumption is probably pretty close to that 3% figure.\nSo why don’t teenagers like classical music?  Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its numerous changes of mood, are problematic for us.  We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast.  In addition, if you believe the experts, we have difficulty paying attention for more than about three minutes; far too short for most pieces of classical music, but perfect for a pop song.  Pop is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to, while appreciating a piece of classical music requires time and concentration.  The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics.  Classical music is incredibly powerful, but not exactly full of the issues that concern teenagers.\nThe way we listen to music has also changed.  In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and an ability to play an instrument was highly valued.  The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert.  Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.  When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing in the background?\nOne of my teachers claims that audiences at classical concerts have actually increased in recent years.  Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers.  In my orchestra we play classical music in all sorts of different places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see virtually nothing but grey hair when I look into the crowd.  I don’t know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your mum and dad love something, the chances are you’ll do your best to stay away from it.\nSome say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra.  They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse.  Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice.  The two activities have become separated.  When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) Even the ones who study music have limited knowledge of classical music.",

Most of us can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and you can tell by the expression on their face that they haven’t a clue.  I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age.  And if you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work.\nThe statistics must be depressing for a lover of classical music.  Apparently only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere 300 copies.  I must say I still find that hard to believe.  So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries?  The older generation are irritated by our obsession with TV and video games, blaming it for most things, but I don’t think there is any connection in this case.  The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets.\nNow, I’m aware that this doesn’t apply to everyone my age.  I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts all the time, but they are a minority.  Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not exactly a classical music fan.  I enjoy a huge range of styles, but judging by what’s stored on my computer, my classical music consumption is probably pretty close to that 3% figure.\nSo why don’t teenagers like classical music?  Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its numerous changes of mood, are problematic for us.  We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast.  In addition, if you believe the experts, we have difficulty paying attention for more than about three minutes; far too short for most pieces of classical music, but perfect for a pop song.  Pop is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to, while appreciating a piece of classical music requires time and concentration.  The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics.  Classical music is incredibly powerful, but not exactly full of the issues that concern teenagers.\nThe way we listen to music has also changed.  In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and an ability to play an instrument was highly valued.  The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert.  Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.  When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing in the background?\nOne of my teachers claims that audiences at classical concerts have actually increased in recent years.  Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers.  In my orchestra we play classical music in all sorts of different places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see virtually nothing but grey hair when I look into the crowd.  I don’t know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your mum and dad love something, the chances are you’ll do your best to stay away from it.\nSome say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra.  They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse.  Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice.

This can include attending concerts, purchasing recordings, or listening to classical music.\n\n4. **Match with the Options**:\n   - **(A) the amount of music she listens to**: This option is plausible as 'consumption' can mean the act of listening to music.\n   - **(B) the amount of music she plays in concerts**: This is less likely because the passage does not mention playing classical music in concerts.\n   - **(C) the number of concerts she attends**: While this could be part of the consumption, it is not comprehensive enough since it does not cover other forms of engagement with classical music.\n   - **(D) the number of recordings she has deleted**: This is not supported by the text as the passage does not discuss deleting recordings.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the options provided, the most comprehensive and accurate definition of 'classical music consumption' in this passage is the overall engagement with classical music, which includes listening to it.

Most of us can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and you can tell by the expression on their face that they haven’t a clue.  I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age.  And if you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work.\nThe statistics must be depressing for a lover of classical music.  Apparently only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere 300 copies.  I must say I still find that hard to believe.  So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries?  The older generation are irritated by our obsession with TV and video games, blaming it for most things, but I don’t think there is any connection in this case.  The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets.\nNow, I’m aware that this doesn’t apply to everyone my age.  I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts all the time, but they are a minority.  Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not exactly a classical music fan.  I enjoy a huge range of styles, but judging by what’s stored on my computer, my classical music consumption is probably pretty close to that 3% figure.\nSo why don’t teenagers like classical music?  Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its numerous changes of mood, are problematic for us.  We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast.  In addition, if you believe the experts, we have difficulty paying attention for more than about three minutes; far too short for most pieces of classical music, but perfect for a pop song.  Pop is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to, while appreciating a piece of classical music requires time and concentration.  The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics.  Classical music is incredibly powerful, but not exactly full of the issues that concern teenagers.\nThe way we listen to music has also changed.  In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and an ability to play an instrument was highly valued.  The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert.  Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.  When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing in the background?\nOne of my teachers claims that audiences at classical concerts have actually increased in recent years.  Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers.  In my orchestra we play classical music in all sorts of different places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see virtually nothing but grey hair when I look into the crowd.  I don’t know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your mum and dad love something, the chances are you’ll do your best to stay away from it.\nSome say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra.  They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse.  Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice.  The two activities have become separated.  When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) We hear it much less than other kinds of music.",

The passage doesn't suggest that classical music is only enjoyed at live concerts.\n   - Option B: \"It is played all around us, but we don’t notice it.\" This aligns well with the passage. The text implies that classical music is available but not commonly heard in everyday settings.\n   - Option C: \"We should appreciate people who play it more.\" This is not mentioned in the passage.\n   - Option D: \"We hear it much less than other kinds of music.\" While this might be implied, the passage specifically talks about the context in which classical music is heard, rather than comparing the frequency of hearing classical music to other types of music.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (B) \"It is played all around us, but we don’t notice it.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (B).",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Here's a breakdown of the passage and the answer to the question:\n\n**Understanding the Passage**\n\nThe passage discusses the decline in interest for classical music among teenagers. The author explores various reasons for this decline, including:\n\n* **Pace and Rhythm:** Classical music's complex structure and rapid changes in mood are not appealing to teenagers who prefer fast-paced, easily digestible music.\n* **Attention Span:** Classical music requires sustained attention, which is difficult for teenagers with short attention spans.\n* **Content:** Pop music often has lyrics and relatable themes, while classical music lacks this element.\n* **Listening Habits:** The ease of access to music through digital platforms has shifted listening habits, and classical music is less frequently played in public spaces.\n* **School Involvement:** While some students enjoy playing classical music in school, it doesn't translate to a preference for listening to it outside of school.\n\n**Answering the Question**\n\nThe passage states that classical music is not a popular choice for teenagers.  The author argues that the reasons for this are:\n\n* **The pace and rhythm of classical music are not appealing to teenagers.**\n* **Teenagers have short attention spans and find it difficult to focus on classical music.**\n* **Pop music is more relatable and engaging for teenagers.**\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (B) It is played all around us, but we don’t notice it.** \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe passage highlights that classical music is rarely played in public spaces and is not a common choice for teenagers.

The fifth paragraph discusses several aspects of classical music, including:\n   - Its declining popularity among younger generations\n   - The limited number of concert tickets sold for classical music events\n   - The low sales figures for classical recordings\n   - The challenge teenagers face in appreciating classical music due to its complex structure and lack of lyrics\n\n3. Now, let's analyze each option based on the information provided:\n\n   (A) \"It is only really enjoyed at live concerts.\"\n   - The passage mentions that only 3% of concert tickets were for classical music events, which suggests that classical music isn't as popular at live concerts compared to other genres. However, it doesn't specifically state that it's only enjoyed there.\n\n   (B) \"It is played all around us, but we don’t notice it.\"\n   - The passage doesn't mention classical music being played around us without our noticing. Instead, it talks about teenagers not being familiar with classical composers.\n\n   (C) \"We should appreciate people who play it more.\"\n   - While the passage implies that classical music might not be appreciated, it doesn't explicitly state that we should appreciate people who play it more.\n\n   (D) \"We hear it much less than other kinds of music.\"\n   - The passage indicates that classical music is less popular among teenagers and younger generations, suggesting that they hear it less often compared to other types of music.\n\nGiven the analysis above, option (D) is the most accurate representation of what the writer says about classical music in the fifth paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

        "Phi35MiniInst_answer": "The writer's main point in the last paragraph is option (D): Schools are to blame if teenagers are not interested in classical music. The writer discusses how, despite some teenagers showing interest in classical music through participation in school orchestras, the overall lack of interest among teenagers towards classical music is not solely due to schools. The writer suggests that the separation of classical music as a performance activity and its lack of appeal in everyday relaxation contexts, such as listening to music at home, contributes to the decline in interest among teenagers. However, the writer also implies that schools might not be fully addressing this issue, as the teenagers who do participate in classical music in school do not necessarily show a broader interest in the genre outside of that context.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "To answer the reading comprehension question, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the last paragraph**: The last paragraph of the passage states, \"Some say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra. They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse. Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice. The two activities have become separated. When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the content of the last paragraph**: This paragraph discusses the idea that blaming schools for the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers might not be accurate. It highlights that many students are enthusiastic about performing classical music in school settings, but do not engage with it outside of these structured environments.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - (A) Pop music is generally more relaxing to listen to than classical music.\n     - This is not supported by the text. The passage does not compare the relaxation levels of pop and classical music.\n   - (B) Those who play classical music often don’t like listening to it.\n     - The text suggests that while students may enjoy playing classical music in a performance context, they do not typically choose to listen to it for relaxation or personal enjoyment.\n   - (C) Good classical musicians usually have to spend a lot of time practising.\n     - While the text mentions that students spend time practicing, this is not the main point of the last paragraph.\n   - (D) Schools are to blame if teenagers are not interested in classical music.\n     - The passage explicitly refutes this notion, stating that the two activities (performing and listening) have become separated, and that blaming schools is not accurate.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (B). The last paragraph emphasizes that even though students may be good at playing classical music in a performance setting, they do not necessarily like listening to it outside of these contexts.\n\nTherefore, the writer’s main point in the last paragraph is:\n(B) Those who play classical music often don’t like listening to it.",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Here's a breakdown of the answer and the reasoning:\n\n**The Main Point**\n\nThe last paragraph argues that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is not due to schools, but rather a disconnect between the way teenagers listen to music and the nature of classical music itself. \n\n**Supporting Evidence**\n\n* **Teenagers' preferences:** The paragraph states that teenagers prefer pop music because of its fast pace, simple structure, and relatable lyrics.\n* **Modern listening habits:** The author points out that teenagers have access to music anytime, anywhere, and that classical music is rarely played in public spaces.\n* **The disconnect between performance and personal preference:** The author notes that while teenagers enjoy playing classical music in school orchestras, they don't typically choose it as their personal music.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **(A) Pop music is generally more relaxing to listen to than classical music.**  This is not the main point. The paragraph focuses on why teenagers don't like classical music, not on its relaxing qualities.\n* **(B) Those who play classical music often don’t like listening to it.** This is not the main point. The author is not arguing that classical musicians dislike their own music.\n* **(C) Good classical musicians usually have to spend a lot of time practising.** This is a general statement about classical musicians, not the main point of the paragraph. \n* **(D) Schools are to blame if teenagers are not interested in classical music.** The author explicitly states that schools are not the cause of the lack of interest.\n\n\n**In conclusion:** The last paragraph focuses on the reasons why teenagers are less likely to enjoy classical music, highlighting the differences in listening habits and preferences compared to the way classical music is experienced. \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To determine the writer's main point in the last paragraph, let's carefully analyze the content:\n\n1. **Context**: The paragraph discusses why teenagers might not like classical music despite its historical significance and enduring popularity.\n\n2. **Key Points**:\n   - Teenagers tend to prefer pop music over classical music.\n   - The pace and rhythm of classical music may be challenging for teenagers who enjoy talking, playing, and thinking quickly.\n   - Pop music is simpler and easier to appreciate, whereas classical music requires time and concentration.\n   - Teenagers do not often seek out classical music as background music in shops or cafes.\n   - There is a clear separation between classical music performance and teenagers' personal enjoyment of the genre.\n   - Some argue that schools are to blame for this lack of interest, but the author questions whether this is accurate.\n\n3. **Main Point**: Based on these points, the central idea appears to be the disconnect between teenagers' preferences and their engagement with classical music.\n\nConsidering the given options:\n- (A) is not supported by the passage.\n- (B) is partially correct but does not capture the broader context.\n- (C) is tangentially related but not the primary focus.\n- (D) aligns closely with the passage, highlighting the issue of schools being blamed for teenagers' lack of interest in classical music.\n\nTherefore, the writer's main point in the last paragraph is:\n\n(D) Schools are to blame if teenagers are not interested in classical music.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "The writer's main point in the last paragraph is (C) Good classical musicians usually have to spend a lot of time practising.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. The writer mentions that some kids are eager to play classical music in their school orchestra and arrive early to practice and stay after school to rehearse.\n2. This indicates that good classical musicians put in a lot of effort and time into their practice.\n3. The writer contrasts this with the fact that classical music is not the preferred choice for teenagers when they want to relax, which further emphasizes the dedication required to excel in classical music.\n\nTherefore, the main point in the last paragraph is that good classical musicians usually have to spend a lot of time practising."

Not that I’m claiming it was an accident, exactly, though it could have been.  Like if I’d tripped over the edge of the bed, for instance, with Dad’s Stanley knife clutched in my hand, the blade might well have gone plunging into the carpet all by itself and carved a huge great chunk out of it.  I mean, that is what could quite easily have happened.  I’m not saying that it did, just that it could have. \nAll I’m saying is, I didn’t mean to damage the carpet.  It wasn’t like I woke up in the morning and thought, ‘Today I shall cut a hole in my carpet.’  It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do.  Then afterwards you wonder why you thought that, only by then it’s too late.  This is something that happens to me rather a lot.  I’m very unfortunate in that way. \nWhat I was doing, in actual fact, wasn’t thinking about cutting holes so much as trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner.  Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat.  It’s really cute!  Very small and painted white, with pink and blue flowers all running round the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors.  Gran used to keep china ornaments in there:  shepherdesses and milkmaids and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons.  I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.  Gran knew I’d always loved her corner cabinet.  I was so excited when she gave it to me!  But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet.  That is why it is shaped like a triangle.  It has to stand in a corner. \nI’ve only got two corners in my bedroom.  This is because it’s the smallest room in the house, tucked away under the roof, and is shaped like a wedge of cheese.  The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the one the size of a broom cupboard belongs to me.  Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his.  And when Tom goes to University, I can take my pick.  But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems to me I’m going to be stuck in my broom cupboard for years to come.  I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom.  It’s cosy, like a nest.  And I love the way the roof slopes down, and the way the window is at floor level.  \nThe only problem is, the lack of corners!  My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.  I’d tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall.  If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...  That was when it came to me.  If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet?  It just seemed like the obvious solution.  What Dad calls lateral thinking.  I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me.  He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’.

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question about what we learn about the writer in the fourth paragraph, let's break down the relevant part of the passage:\n\n\"All I was doing, in actual fact, wasn’t thinking about cutting holes so much as trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It’s really cute! Very small and painted white, with pink and blue flowers all running round the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there: shepherdesses and milkmaids and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there. Gran knew I’d always loved her corner cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That is why it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I’ve only got two corners in my bedroom. This is because it’s the smallest room in the house, tucked away under the roof, and is shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the one the size of a broom cupboard belongs to me. Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can take my pick. But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems to me I’m going to be stuck in my broom cupboard for years to come. I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom. It’s cosy, like a nest. And I love the way the roof slopes down, and the way the window is at floor level.\"\n\nFrom this passage, we can infer that the writer is:\n\n(B) Resigned to her situation.\n\nThe writer describes their bedroom as the smallest and least desirable room in the house, and they express a sense of resignation by saying, \"I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom. It’s cosy, like a nest.\" This indicates that despite the limitations, the writer has come to accept and even appreciate their situation. The other options do not align with the content of the passage. The writer is not looking forward to leaving home, resentful of other family members, or determined to improve their bedroom. Instead, they are content with their current living situation."

She admits to having her cellphone within a few feet at most times of the day, but not for frivolous purposes. It isn't just a means of texting her friends; it is a tool that teens have embraced to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. It is expected that students today have immediate access to the world and that they be reachable at all times, hence creating what appears to be a cell phone addiction. \nWith the introduction of smart phones, tablets and social media, students can now take their work on the go with them, and do their homework wherever they happen to be. Instead of listening to music on\t\tthe drive to school, they could be listening to downloaded language lessons. In essence, schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate, but now require 24-hour attention from already overworked teens. \nMany teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after school activities, family obligations and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation polled American teenagers and found that about 20 percent of all teens get the recommended nine hours a night. Moreover, 28 percent of teens polled admitted falling asleep in school about once a week, because of sleep deprivation.\nTeenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all of her other activities are accounted for, she gets about 18 hours of leisure time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is anything but impressive. And Olsen rarely wastes those hours on social media or television. Instead, she focuses much of her energy on volunteer work. ‘I think that the stereotype of teenagers is that they have a narrow view of the world, that their only focus is on themselves and their own personal and immediate interests,’ Olsen says.\nDespite that image of selfish teens, Olsen says that her favorite part of the week is the time she spends volunteering. ‘I have a heart for serving others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and wider community during the week.’ \nIn 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but without a doubt, they will still be proving it wrong and forcing the world forward. There will be another generation of students who are taking the world by storm, all before they leave school.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) There are valid reasons why teenagers use them so much.

She clarifies that while she does have her cellphone within a few feet of her most of the time, it is not for frivolous purposes. Instead, she and other teenagers have embraced cell phones as tools to make their lives and those of their caretakers easier.\n\nThe passage also highlights the impact of smartphones, tablets, and social media on students' lives. These technologies allow students to take their work on the go, extending their schoolwork and other activities beyond the school gate. This results in a need for 24-hour attention from teenagers who already have a packed schedule with school, after-school activities, family obligations, and homework.\n\nIn summary, Kristen Loose acknowledges that teenagers do use their cell phones, but it is not for mere entertainment. Instead, they use it as a tool to manage their busy lives and responsibilities. This aligns with option (A) \"There are valid reasons why teenagers use them so much.\"\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are not directly supported by the passage.

That's being an American teenager today. Teenage boys and girls can't simply go to school and blend into the background, because average is no longer enough. Mediocrity isn't acceptable and a lack of excessive ambition is considered laziness.\n‘People, often adults, forget how much pressure that teenagers have these days. We have piles of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores and responsibilities at home, all in addition to trying to maintain some sort of social life,’ teenager Kristen Loose says. Despite these stresses being the norm in teenage life today, the negative stereotypes of teenagers still exist, often perpetuated by people in the media. You know what I mean: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless and self-absorbed. While there is evidence that they do exist, lumping the entire generation into such a category is not considered fair by some. ‘A lot of people would assume that we spend the majority of our time with our eyes glued to the television and our hands glued to our cell phones,’ Loose says.\nLoose believes this assumption is largely incorrect. She admits to having her cellphone within a few feet at most times of the day, but not for frivolous purposes. It isn't just a means of texting her friends; it is a tool that teens have embraced to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. It is expected that students today have immediate access to the world and that they be reachable at all times, hence creating what appears to be a cell phone addiction. \nWith the introduction of smart phones, tablets and social media, students can now take their work on the go with them, and do their homework wherever they happen to be. Instead of listening to music on\t\tthe drive to school, they could be listening to downloaded language lessons. In essence, schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate, but now require 24-hour attention from already overworked teens. \nMany teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after school activities, family obligations and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night.

There will be another generation of students who are taking the world by storm, all before they leave school.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) She deserves our admiration.",

Even then, it happened more by accident than design. ‘My younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase that’s so common among children, and which I hadn’t experienced. In fact, I tended to dismiss it. I reluctantly lent him a hand with a science project, and when I came across an article about some of the recent discoveries in the field, it just blew my mind. I knew immediately that this was something I wanted to commit myself to.’ \nI am curious to know what encouragement she got because Palaeontology was by no means a common career choice for young people at that time. ‘I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,’ she laughs. ‘This guy, Matt Cornelius, was famous already, despite being quite young. At first I was a nervous wreck, even though he had a reputation for being approachable and easy-going. I was still worried he’d think I was just an annoying kid pestering him with my questions. The whole thing could easily have been awkward and embarrassing,’ Chloe tells me. ‘But I felt more at ease when he showed so much patience and willingness to listen.’ \nI cannot resist bringing up the question of the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowns for a moment. ‘I have to admit that films such as Jurassic Park featuring dinosaurs created by special effects technology have led to a huge surge in public interest in these creatures, though not necessarily in Palaeontology more generally. However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading. What irritates me is that we're either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or rather geeky losers, figures of fun who don’t know how to relate to people. And films fail to represent accurately the everyday reality of our working lives.’ I ask her to explain.\n‘My job is remarkably varied. I spend lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also have to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications.’ \nWhile it's not necessarily something Chloe is required to do on a daily basis, there’s also the question of communicating scientific findings to the public, if time allows. The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. ‘There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don’t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it’s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.’ \nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. ‘I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period. We succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because we’ve learned such a tremendous amount about dinosaurs recently and the ones which are depicted in this programme are radically different to those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are easily the most life-like that have ever been portrayed.’ \nWhy does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain the focus of ongoing research?  ‘I suspect that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary \"Walking with Dinosaurs\" to ensure accurate portrayals of dinosaurs and their time periods.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\n(A) she limited the questions she asked so as not to irritate him.\n(B) she knew that he was particularly good at talking to shy people.\n(C) she hadn’t expected him to be as friendly as he was.\n(D) she realised she needn’t have been so anxious about it.\n\nThe passage states that Chloe was initially nervous and worried that Matt Cornelius would think she was annoying. However, it also mentions that Matt Cornelius was known to be approachable and easy-going, which helped Chloe feel more at ease. This suggests that Chloe's anxiety was alleviated by Matt's friendly nature, which she had not fully expected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(C) she hadn’t expected him to be as friendly as he was."

Chloe frowns for a moment. ‘I have to admit that films such as Jurassic Park featuring dinosaurs created by special effects technology have led to a huge surge in public interest in these creatures, though not necessarily in Palaeontology more generally. However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading.

The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. ‘There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don’t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it’s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.’ \nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. ‘I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period.

However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading. What irritates me is that we're either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or rather geeky losers, figures of fun who don’t know how to relate to people. And films fail to represent accurately the everyday reality of our working lives.’ I ask her to explain.\n‘My job is remarkably varied. I spend lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also have to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications.’ \nWhile it's not necessarily something Chloe is required to do on a daily basis, there’s also the question of communicating scientific findings to the public, if time allows. The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. ‘There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don’t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it’s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.’ \nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. ‘I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period. We succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because we’ve learned such a tremendous amount about dinosaurs recently and the ones which are depicted in this programme are radically different to those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are easily the most life-like that have ever been portrayed.’ \nWhy does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain the focus of ongoing research?  ‘I suspect that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered. And Palaeontology is a great form of time travel.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) She feels it is her duty to make science more comprehensible.",

Even then, it happened more by accident than design. ‘My younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase that’s so common among children, and which I hadn’t experienced. In fact, I tended to dismiss it. I reluctantly lent him a hand with a science project, and when I came across an article about some of the recent discoveries in the field, it just blew my mind. I knew immediately that this was something I wanted to commit myself to.’ \nI am curious to know what encouragement she got because Palaeontology was by no means a common career choice for young people at that time. ‘I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,’ she laughs. ‘This guy, Matt Cornelius, was famous already, despite being quite young. At first I was a nervous wreck, even though he had a reputation for being approachable and easy-going. I was still worried he’d think I was just an annoying kid pestering him with my questions. The whole thing could easily have been awkward and embarrassing,’ Chloe tells me. ‘But I felt more at ease when he showed so much patience and willingness to listen.’ \nI cannot resist bringing up the question of the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowns for a moment. ‘I have to admit that films such as Jurassic Park featuring dinosaurs created by special effects technology have led to a huge surge in public interest in these creatures, though not necessarily in Palaeontology more generally. However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading. What irritates me is that we're either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or rather geeky losers, figures of fun who don’t know how to relate to people. And films fail to represent accurately the everyday reality of our working lives.’ I ask her to explain.\n‘My job is remarkably varied. I spend lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also have to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications.’ \nWhile it's not necessarily something Chloe is required to do on a daily basis, there’s also the question of communicating scientific findings to the public, if time allows. The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. ‘There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don’t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it’s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.’ \nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. ‘I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period. We succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because we’ve learned such a tremendous amount about dinosaurs recently and the ones which are depicted in this programme are radically different to those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are easily the most life-like that have ever been portrayed.’ \nWhy does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain the focus of ongoing research?  ‘I suspect that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered. And Palaeontology is a great form of time travel.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) they make us appreciate that the world remains a mysterious place.",

        "processed_text": "What does Zuzi Morgan say about the board game café?\nOptions:\n(A) It satisfies a basic human need.\n(B) Its appeal to customers lies in its originality.\n(C) Technology is sometimes a distraction there.\n(D) Once people have been there, they tend to return regularly.\nReference Passage: John and Zuzi Morgan have set up a café in Oxford, in the UK, where people can not only enjoy a cup of coffee and some cake, but play a board game too. The owners’ hope is that people enjoy the experience so much they want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a \nfull-time business: ‘There’s so much technology. Everybody’s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.’ The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's café are known as ‘Eurogames’. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building.\nThe first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan (later rebranded Catan), created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, keeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion, with none of the players feeling left out. That crucial factor was refined in the ‘co-operative' games that followed, in which every player wins or loses as a team member, provoking a lot more social interaction.\nPandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming’s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. ‘When I played that with friends we got scared,’ recalls Leacock. ‘There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.’\nLeacock’s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. ‘Games were my favourite birthday gift,’ he says, ‘but I’d get very excited, open up the box, then we’d play and there would just be crushing disappointment.’ So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards of the many games they played together and try to design something better using the same components.\nPandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design. It incorporates, Leacock explains, ‘a tremendous amount of storytelling. It’s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. It is an unfolding story.’\nThe growth of the video games industry has, perhaps contrary to expectations, been one of the biggest factors in the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games – largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing. ‘Video games and board games have learned an awful lot from each other,’ says Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company. ‘Everyone’s a mobile gamer now. Speak to anyone who’s got a smartphone, they’ve got at least one game they like to play on it. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.’\nFor a time, video-gaming offered a level of physical social interaction, at the arcade or through multi-player sofa games that friends or family members could play at the same time, in the same room. Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. So some people who had previously enjoyed playing video games started looking for a way of playing games again with other people who were physically present. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world and this trend is set to continue.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) It satisfies a basic human need.",

The owners’ hope is that people enjoy the experience so much they want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a \nfull-time business: ‘There’s so much technology. Everybody’s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.’ The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's café are known as ‘Eurogames’. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building.\nThe first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan (later rebranded Catan), created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, keeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion, with none of the players feeling left out. That crucial factor was refined in the ‘co-operative' games that followed, in which every player wins or loses as a team member, provoking a lot more social interaction.\nPandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming’s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. ‘When I played that with friends we got scared,’ recalls Leacock. ‘There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.’\nLeacock’s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. ‘Games were my favourite birthday gift,’ he says, ‘but I’d get very excited, open up the box, then we’d play and there would just be crushing disappointment.’ So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards of the many games they played together and try to design something better using the same components.\nPandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design. It incorporates, Leacock explains, ‘a tremendous amount of storytelling. It’s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. It is an unfolding story.’\nThe growth of the video games industry has, perhaps contrary to expectations, been one of the biggest factors in the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games – largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing. ‘Video games and board games have learned an awful lot from each other,’ says Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company. ‘Everyone’s a mobile gamer now. Speak to anyone who’s got a smartphone, they’ve got at least one game they like to play on it. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.’\nFor a time, video-gaming offered a level of physical social interaction, at the arcade or through multi-player sofa games that friends or family members could play at the same time, in the same room. Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. So some people who had previously enjoyed playing video games started looking for a way of playing games again with other people who were physically present. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world and this trend is set to continue.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) every player being involved all the time",

It states, \"Pandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming’s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. ‘When I played that with friends we got scared,’ recalls Leacock. ‘There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.’\"\n\n4. Leacock's goal for Pandemic was to create a game that would evoke a similar emotional experience to Lord of the Rings, where players would feel good at the end of the game regardless of the outcome.\n\n5. The passage concludes by discussing the impact of video games on board games and the social aspect of gaming, which is not directly related to the question about Leacock's intentions for Pandemic.\n\nBased on the passage, the correct option that reflects Matt Leacock's intention when designing Pandemic is:\n\n(B) it would not be as emotionally demanding as Lord of the Rings.\n\nLeacock wanted to create a game that would be emotionally engaging but not as intense as Lord of the Rings, where players would still feel good at the end of the game, whether they won or lost. This aligns with the passage's description of Leacock's inspiration and his goal for Pandemic."

The owners’ hope is that people enjoy the experience so much they want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a \nfull-time business: ‘There’s so much technology. Everybody’s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.’ The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's café are known as ‘Eurogames’. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building.\nThe first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan (later rebranded Catan), created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, keeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion, with none of the players feeling left out. That crucial factor was refined in the ‘co-operative' games that followed, in which every player wins or loses as a team member, provoking a lot more social interaction.\nPandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming’s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. ‘When I played that with friends we got scared,’ recalls Leacock. ‘There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.’\nLeacock’s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. ‘Games were my favourite birthday gift,’ he says, ‘but I’d get very excited, open up the box, then we’d play and there would just be crushing disappointment.’ So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards of the many games they played together and try to design something better using the same components.\nPandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design. It incorporates, Leacock explains, ‘a tremendous amount of storytelling. It’s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. It is an unfolding story.’\nThe growth of the video games industry has, perhaps contrary to expectations, been one of the biggest factors in the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games – largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing. ‘Video games and board games have learned an awful lot from each other,’ says Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company. ‘Everyone’s a mobile gamer now. Speak to anyone who’s got a smartphone, they’ve got at least one game they like to play on it. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.’\nFor a time, video-gaming offered a level of physical social interaction, at the arcade or through multi-player sofa games that friends or family members could play at the same time, in the same room. Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. So some people who had previously enjoyed playing video games started looking for a way of playing games again with other people who were physically present. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world and this trend is set to continue.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) board games make up for something that modern video games lack.",

James describes his job as one where he spends his days tasting chocolate, ensuring high-quality products, and working in a variety of settings, including a food lab and traveling abroad to buy raw materials.\n2. He mentions that no two days are the same, which indicates a lack of routine.\n3.

But I’m not joking! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting the chocolate is an essential part of making sure that customers get perfect bars of high-quality chocolate from the company I work for.\nEvery week I receive samples, small amounts that show what the chocolate is like, from our factory and I have to check them for taste, texture and smell. I also have to taste the raw materials we usually use – the nuts, fruit and so on. I spend days choosing the most suitable ones to go into the chocolate. \nJust beside my company office I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make – and I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to play with. It’s wonderful to have a private space I can go off to during the day. \nNo two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab and others I’m out of the country buying our raw materials and, as I’ve got a young family, that can be difficult. But that kind of variety, and lack of routine, is something I love about the job, although I think it still comes second to the chocolate itself! The question I get asked most is whether I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt I didn’t want to eat it.

He spends his days tasting chocolate to ensure quality. This option highlights the rigorous testing process and the commitment to ensuring high-quality chocolate.\n\n**B:** \"We choose only the best ingredients – just chocolate beans, sugar and milk.

It focuses more on the basic ingredients rather than the overall quality control process.\n\n**C:** \"We’re proud of being so environmentally friendly – all our ingredients are bought from local businesses.\"\n- This option emphasizes environmental sustainability, which is commendable, but it does not directly highlight the core aspect of James' role—tasting and ensuring the quality of the chocolate.\n\n**D:** \"We check everything that goes into our chocolate, so that you can enjoy the best chocolate possible.\"\n- This option also emphasizes quality control and customer satisfaction, similar to Option A. However, it uses slightly different wording and does not mention the detailed process of tasting raw materials and final products.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption **A** (\"Every single bar of chocolate that leaves our factory is tested for its taste.\") is the most appropriate advertisement because it directly reflects James' role in ensuring the quality of the chocolate through rigorous testing.

These satchels now sell in world-famous shops, and are the bag chosen by many celebrities. \nBefore choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses, from cake decorating to party planning, considering her options, rather than going with her first idea. Once she’d decided, she found not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, ‘Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.’ She involved family from the start, working with her mother, who’d never had a career, but has a natural business ability, and the design came from children’s story books.\nAlthough Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, they’ve been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they’d comment in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed her company produces the satchels. Julie now loves waiting to see which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for original styles, keeping her products new and exciting.\nThere was a challenging time when a company producing satchels copied Julie’s design to sell similar products, as a result she now makes sure she’s as confident in the production team as she is in her own staff. Visitors comment on the positive feeling in her offices – people love working there, There’s now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it’s the team who make it a special place. \nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B1\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) explain what helped a business develop.",

Julie started her company with basic fashion knowledge and decided to create a business around satchels, a traditional bag used by schoolchildren.\n2. She considered various business ideas before settling on satchels, involving her family, especially her mother, who has natural business ability.\n3. Julie faced skepticism from others who believed there was no demand for satchels, but she was convinced of their potential.\n4. She used fashion blogs to create interest in her product, which helped her company grow.\n5. Julie's company faced a challenge when another company copied her design, leading her to ensure confidence in her production team.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) The passage does not mention Julie's interest in an old design.\n(B) The passage states that Julie's mother has natural business ability, which was beneficial to the company.\n(C) The passage does not mention Julie's previous experience in running various businesses.\n(D) The passage does not mention Julie convincing other producers to support her plan.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) she knew her mother’s business experience would be a benefit.",

These satchels now sell in world-famous shops, and are the bag chosen by many celebrities. \nBefore choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses, from cake decorating to party planning, considering her options, rather than going with her first idea. Once she’d decided, she found not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, ‘Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.’ She involved family from the start, working with her mother, who’d never had a career, but has a natural business ability, and the design came from children’s story books.\nAlthough Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, they’ve been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they’d comment in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed her company produces the satchels. Julie now loves waiting to see which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for original styles, keeping her products new and exciting.\nThere was a challenging time when a company producing satchels copied Julie’s design to sell similar products, as a result she now makes sure she’s as confident in the production team as she is in her own staff. Visitors comment on the positive feeling in her offices – people love working there, There’s now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it’s the team who make it a special place. \nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) Get the latest look based on an old idea – everyone wants one of these – see them from New York to Tokyo!",

Julie's journey from having basic fashion knowledge to creating a successful business with her unique satchels.\n2. The inspiration behind the satchel design, which came from children's storybooks and involved her family, especially her mother's business acumen.\n3. The initial challenges Julie faced, such as skepticism from others and the need to create interest in her product.\n4. The role of fashion bloggers in promoting Julie's satchels and how she leverages the internet community for ideas to keep her products fresh and exciting.\n5. The growth of her business, from selling one satchel a week to increasing production speed and maintaining a strong team.\n6. The importance of protecting her design and ensuring the production team's confidence, as well as the positive work environment in her offices.\n\nConsidering these points, the most relevant option for a blog about Julie's satchel business would be:\n\n(D) Get them while you can – because they are all hand-made, there’s a long wait for each item – but it’s worth it!\n\nThis option highlights the handmade nature of the satchels, the waiting time for each item, and the value of owning one, which aligns with the passage's emphasis on the unique, personalized aspect of Julie's business and the growth and success she has achieved.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's break down the information provided in the reference passage and analyze how it relates to the given options.\n\n1. **Context Understanding**: The passage describes Julie Deane's journey from a novice in fashion to successfully running a business selling satchels. It highlights her strategic use of fashion blogs to promote her product and mentions the importance of the internet community for generating ideas and maintaining the uniqueness of her products.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n\n   - **Option (A)**: This option talks about custom-made bags, which does not align with the context of Julie's satchels being mass-produced and sold in shops.\n   \n   - **Option (B)**: This suggests a trend or popularity of a specific type of bag across different cities, which could be related to Julie's satchels becoming popular worldwide. However, the passage doesn't mention any specific trend or popularity based on location.\n   \n   - **Option (C)**: This implies that the bags have become more affordable due to production moving abroad. The passage does not mention anything about relocating production or changes in pricing strategies.\n   \n   - **Option (D)**: This talks about the hand-made nature of the items leading to longer wait times, which could be relevant since the passage mentions that Julie's company produces satchels quickly and efficiently, but also notes that the initial process involved a long wait for each item before scaling up.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the passage, the most fitting option would be (D). The passage indicates that the satchels were initially produced slowly due to being handmade, but as the business grew, production sped up. However, the core aspect of the handmade nature leading to potential delays still holds true, especially when considering the early stages of the business.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"What might a blog about Julie say?\" is:\n\n**(D) Get them while you can – because they are all hand-made, there’s a long wait for each item – but it’s worth it!**",

It’s around the corner from where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club! \nWe decided early on that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films in. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we hired an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was freezing cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which means we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit.\nEach time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us, especially now we’ve got our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more concerns about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. \nThe website’s been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve been to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always good to get back to our own club again! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés.  Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience love the special activities we put on with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) He wanted the opportunity to share opinions about films.",

We get lots of children, but it’s so important to include all ages.\n(D) We’ve put up our ticket prices, but food and drinks are included in the price, so we think it’s good value.\nReference Passage: My city has a typical modern cinema showing all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s around the corner from where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club! \nWe decided early on that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films in. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we hired an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was freezing cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which means we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit.\nEach time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us, especially now we’ve got our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more concerns about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. \nThe website’s been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve been to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always good to get back to our own club again! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés.  Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.

Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview about her book, Janine said, ‘Because of my father’s job, my family’s moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book focus on Amelia’s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother. As I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.’\nJanine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.\nOne review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges, and this is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best selling authors.\nJanine’s still getting used to being a famous writer: ‘At first, I hid when people recognised me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is hang out with my friends for a while, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) Her experiences of living in different places were useful.",

The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a young writers' website and won first prize.\n4.

It only mentions that Janine is a better writer than several other best-selling authors.\n\n(C) the characters’ lives are described in a realistic way.\n- The passage states that the characters face difficult challenges, which helps readers believe in them. This suggests that the characters' lives are described in a realistic way.\n\n(D) some readers might find the story too long.\n- The passage mentions that the novel is not particularly long, so this option is not supported by the passage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n(C) the characters’ lives are described in a realistic way."

Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview about her book, Janine said, ‘Because of my father’s job, my family’s moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book focus on Amelia’s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother. As I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.’\nJanine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.\nOne review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges, and this is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best selling authors.\nJanine’s still getting used to being a famous writer: ‘At first, I hid when people recognised me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them.

        "processed_text": "In the first paragraph, the writer implies that the idea of home advantage\nOptions:\n(A) is best understood by logical reasoning.\n(B) is being challenged in different ways.\n(C) is upheld by evidence from new research.\n(D) is connected to financial strength.\nReference Passage: Everyone knows that sports teams enjoy a big advantage whenever they play at home.  But does anyone know why?  Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious.  But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.  Two driving forces have served to question whether traditional wisdom can be relied on when it comes to explaining home advantage: science and money.  Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform to their full potential and in so doing they have raised myriad theories on the impact of home advantage.  Meanwhile, the moneymen want to know why home advantage should still matter at all.  If they are paid enough surely the players should feel comfortable anywhere?\nSo where does all this leave the fans?  Would it matter say, if Manchester United were to play some of their home games in the Far East so as to catch their fan base there?  It would to the British home fans, who believe that their team need their passion and their loyal commitment to the cause, which may be why they confuse cause and effect.  It is human nature to imagine that a sequence of events is best explained by the order in which we remember them rather than the order in which they happened.  When a team go forward, the home support gets to its feet and starts to generate more noise; every now and then, one of these forward moves results in a goal, and the crowd sound explodes.  What fans tend to remember is that when they began to holler, scream and shout, a goal was scored.  What they omit are the countless times when the noise fizzled out because the move did not succeed.\nHowever, there is one conventional fan’s-eye view that does seem to be confirmed by the scientific evidence.  As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.  In a now famous experiment, a sample of referees was exposed to a recording of a match, with half watching with all the crowd effects and half watching a silent version.  The researchers found that the referees who heard the version with sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team than the ones who saw the game in silence (though, interestingly, the baying of the home crowd did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team).

One possible explanation may be that home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in baseball there may be less team spirit since it is more about individual confrontations between batter and pitcher.  Team sports are about co-ordinating with your team mates.

It mentions that sports scientists and money men are challenging the notion of home advantage. \n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Writer's Implication\nThe writer uses phrases like \"much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question\" and \"traditional wisdom can be relied on when it comes to explaining home advantage,\" implying that the idea of home advantage is no longer unquestioned.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Option Against the Implication\n- **Option A:** \"is best understood by logical reasoning.\"\n    - This option doesn't align with the implication that the idea is being questioned and challenged. Logical reasoning isn't necessarily the issue here; it's the idea itself that is being questioned.\n  \n- **Option B:** \"is being challenged in different ways.\"\n    - This aligns perfectly with the passage.

But does anyone know why?  Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious.  But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.  Two driving forces have served to question whether traditional wisdom can be relied on when it comes to explaining home advantage: science and money.  Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform to their full potential and in so doing they have raised myriad theories on the impact of home advantage.  Meanwhile, the moneymen want to know why home advantage should still matter at all.  If they are paid enough surely the players should feel comfortable anywhere?\nSo where does all this leave the fans?  Would it matter say, if Manchester United were to play some of their home games in the Far East so as to catch their fan base there?  It would to the British home fans, who believe that their team need their passion and their loyal commitment to the cause, which may be why they confuse cause and effect.  It is human nature to imagine that a sequence of events is best explained by the order in which we remember them rather than the order in which they happened.  When a team go forward, the home support gets to its feet and starts to generate more noise; every now and then, one of these forward moves results in a goal, and the crowd sound explodes.  What fans tend to remember is that when they began to holler, scream and shout, a goal was scored.  What they omit are the countless times when the noise fizzled out because the move did not succeed.\nHowever, there is one conventional fan’s-eye view that does seem to be confirmed by the scientific evidence.  As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.  In a now famous experiment, a sample of referees was exposed to a recording of a match, with half watching with all the crowd effects and half watching a silent version.  The researchers found that the referees who heard the version with sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team than the ones who saw the game in silence (though, interestingly, the baying of the home crowd did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team).  This coincided with the actual decisions of the match official on the day.

But does anyone know why?  Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious.  But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.  Two driving forces have served to question whether traditional wisdom can be relied on when it comes to explaining home advantage: science and money.  Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform to their full potential and in so doing they have raised myriad theories on the impact of home advantage.  Meanwhile, the moneymen want to know why home advantage should still matter at all.  If they are paid enough surely the players should feel comfortable anywhere?\nSo where does all this leave the fans?  Would it matter say, if Manchester United were to play some of their home games in the Far East so as to catch their fan base there?  It would to the British home fans, who believe that their team need their passion and their loyal commitment to the cause, which may be why they confuse cause and effect.  It is human nature to imagine that a sequence of events is best explained by the order in which we remember them rather than the order in which they happened.  When a team go forward, the home support gets to its feet and starts to generate more noise; every now and then, one of these forward moves results in a goal, and the crowd sound explodes.  What fans tend to remember is that when they began to holler, scream and shout, a goal was scored.  What they omit are the countless times when the noise fizzled out because the move did not succeed.\nHowever, there is one conventional fan’s-eye view that does seem to be confirmed by the scientific evidence.  As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.  In a now famous experiment, a sample of referees was exposed to a recording of a match, with half watching with all the crowd effects and half watching a silent version.  The researchers found that the referees who heard the version with sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team than the ones who saw the game in silence (though, interestingly, the baying of the home crowd did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team).

The researchers concluded that referees shield themselves from extra stress that would be caused by making calls against the home team.  It’s not that the officials do what the crowd wants; they just try not to do whatever would direct the crowd’s fury straight at them.\nRecent studies of home advantage have analysed long-term historical trends.  They reveal that home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.  For instance, during the earliest years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70 per cent of the points on offer, compared to 60 per cent today.  One reason for this may well be travel, which used to be a laborious business; these days, football virtuosos are ferried around in unimaginable luxury and, if the hotel room isn’t good enough, someone from the club is at hand to find them another.  Local conditions were more likely to vary wildly but now the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency.  And yet, plausible as all these explanations are, none of them really fits the data.  These changes – cosseted stars, modern-day man servants, identikit stadiums (and also bringing in professional arbitrators) – all happened relatively recently, in the past decade or two.\nThe enduring mystery is why home advantage should vary depending on the sport.  Basketball is the game where playing at home is most advantageous, closely followed by football.  But baseball remains the sport where home advantage counts for least.  One possible explanation may be that home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in baseball there may be less team spirit since it is more about individual confrontations between batter and pitcher.  Team sports are about co-ordinating with your team mates.  In a sport such as basketball, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court.  It is this confidence that seems to be boosted by the familiarity of playing at home, regardless of any differences in the playing conditions.\nThere is a further possibility, one that connects to the darker side of sport.  Researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were average before training sessions and away matches, but were up to 67 per cent higher before home matches.  This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers such as in the recent Rugby World Cup.  There were two classic games in which the underdogs, playing at home, triumphed against better-fancied opposition, using grit, channelled aggression and a seemingly unquenchable refusal to be intimidated – this had all the hallmarks of home advantage.

It mentions several factors that have contributed to this change, including:\n\n* **Travel:**  The ease of travel for players has reduced the impact of home advantage due to the luxury of travel arrangements.\n* **Stadiums:**  Modern stadiums are becoming more standardized, making the playing field less different between home and away venues.\n* **Professional Arbitrators:**  The passage mentions \"professional arbitrators\" as a possible explanation, but it doesn't explicitly state that this is a factor in home advantage.\n\n**Finding the Answer**\n\nThe phrase \"football virtuosos\" is used in the context of the changing nature of home advantage.  The passage states:\n\n* **\"Football virtuosos are ferried around in unimaginable luxury and, if the hotel room isn’t good enough, someone from the club is at hand to find them another.\"**\n\nThis sentence suggests that the phrase \"football virtuosos\" refers to **the high level of skill and talent of professional football players**.

We're discussing the concept of \"home advantage\" in sports, specifically focusing on how it works and changing over time.\n\n2. Now, let's identify the key phrase: 'football virtuosos'. This phrase refers to skilled football players.\n\n3. The question asks where the term 'football virtuosos' is mentioned again in the passage.\n\n4. Scanning through the text, we find the following sentence:\n   \"As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.

But does anyone know why?  Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious.  But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.  Two driving forces have served to question whether traditional wisdom can be relied on when it comes to explaining home advantage: science and money.  Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform to their full potential and in so doing they have raised myriad theories on the impact of home advantage.  Meanwhile, the moneymen want to know why home advantage should still matter at all.  If they are paid enough surely the players should feel comfortable anywhere?\nSo where does all this leave the fans?  Would it matter say, if Manchester United were to play some of their home games in the Far East so as to catch their fan base there?  It would to the British home fans, who believe that their team need their passion and their loyal commitment to the cause, which may be why they confuse cause and effect.  It is human nature to imagine that a sequence of events is best explained by the order in which we remember them rather than the order in which they happened.  When a team go forward, the home support gets to its feet and starts to generate more noise; every now and then, one of these forward moves results in a goal, and the crowd sound explodes.  What fans tend to remember is that when they began to holler, scream and shout, a goal was scored.  What they omit are the countless times when the noise fizzled out because the move did not succeed.\nHowever, there is one conventional fan’s-eye view that does seem to be confirmed by the scientific evidence.  As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.  In a now famous experiment, a sample of referees was exposed to a recording of a match, with half watching with all the crowd effects and half watching a silent version.  The researchers found that the referees who heard the version with sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team than the ones who saw the game in silence (though, interestingly, the baying of the home crowd did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team).  This coincided with the actual decisions of the match official on the day.  The researchers concluded that referees shield themselves from extra stress that would be caused by making calls against the home team.  It’s not that the officials do what the crowd wants; they just try not to do whatever would direct the crowd’s fury straight at them.\nRecent studies of home advantage have analysed long-term historical trends.  They reveal that home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.  For instance, during the earliest years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70 per cent of the points on offer, compared to 60 per cent today.  One reason for this may well be travel, which used to be a laborious business; these days, football virtuosos are ferried around in unimaginable luxury and, if the hotel room isn’t good enough, someone from the club is at hand to find them another.  Local conditions were more likely to vary wildly but now the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency.  And yet, plausible as all these explanations are, none of them really fits the data.  These changes – cosseted stars, modern-day man servants, identikit stadiums (and also bringing in professional arbitrators) – all happened relatively recently, in the past decade or two.\nThe enduring mystery is why home advantage should vary depending on the sport.  Basketball is the game where playing at home is most advantageous, closely followed by football.  But baseball remains the sport where home advantage counts for least.  One possible explanation may be that home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in baseball there may be less team spirit since it is more about individual confrontations between batter and pitcher.  Team sports are about co-ordinating with your team mates.  In a sport such as basketball, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court.  It is this confidence that seems to be boosted by the familiarity of playing at home, regardless of any differences in the playing conditions.\nThere is a further possibility, one that connects to the darker side of sport.  Researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were average before training sessions and away matches, but were up to 67 per cent higher before home matches.  This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers such as in the recent Rugby World Cup.  There were two classic games in which the underdogs, playing at home, triumphed against better-fancied opposition, using grit, channelled aggression and a seemingly unquenchable refusal to be intimidated – this had all the hallmarks of home advantage. As one referee aptly summed it up, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) it is human nature for a team to protect its patch.",

        "processed_text": "What does the writer imply about the founder of the multinational corporation?\nOptions:\n(A) He is unwise to employ his daughter in his company.\n(B) He is dishonestly copying an idea from another company.\n(C) He is using his daughter to make a planned change appear more acceptable.\n(D) He is merely trying to increase his personal popularity.\nReference Passage: The founder of a multinational corporation recently announced that his company would no longer be keeping track of its employees’ paid holiday time. The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy. According to the founder of the multinational corporation, the idea came to him via a cheery email (reproduced in many newspapers) from his daughter. In it she sounds suspiciously like a copywriter from her father’s media team. Setting aside the fact that the means by which the announcement was made seems like a hollow attempt at ‘humanising’ what may turn out to be a less than generous policy decision, let us ask: is the idea practical?\nThe internet company and the multinational corporation are fundamentally distinct – the former has 2,000 employees and provides a single service, while the latter has 50,000 employees with dozens of subsidiary companies providing services as diverse as financial services, transport, and healthcare. The approach of ‘take as much time off as you want as long as you’re sure it won’t damage the business’ seems better suited to a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules, and so may be more comfortable in assessing whether their absence would harm the business – in any case a problematically abstract notion.\nThe founder of the multinational has stated that his employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they ‘feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business –  or, for that matter, their careers.’ Is it possible to be that sure? No matter how many loose ends you manage to tie up in advance of a holiday, there is always a mountain of work to come back to. That is simply the nature of leave; you put your work on hold, but its accumulation is inevitable and beyond your control. Someone who follows these guidelines would likely not go at all, or, at the very least, would feel overly guilty about going. Increased levels of guilt lead to stress and this, together with workers not taking sufficient leave, would lead to a decrease in productivity in the long run.\nThe situation could be compounded by pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Such pressure already affects decisions such as when to start and end the working day. Particularly in the corporate sector, there is a culture of working late, and it is easy to see how this could translate into a ‘no holiday’ culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotion. Similarly, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Essentially, they would no longer have their legal entitlement to fall back on. Perhaps then, the policy would result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave, or, they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete.\nModern technology, which allows us to receive work messages whenever and wherever we are, has blurred the distinction between work and leisure time. The internet company apparently began their unlimited leave policy when their employees asked how this new way of working could be reconciled with the company’s old-fashioned time-off policy. That is to say, if their employer was no longer able to accurately track employees’ total time on the job, why should it apply a different and outmoded standard to their time away from it? However, a potentially problematic corollary of having no set working hours is that all hours are feasibly working hours. Employees can never be sure whether or not their working hours are being monitored by their employer, causing them to internalise this scrutiny and become self-disciplining, with possibly destructive effects. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity and productivity which are cited as the desired results of the unlimited leave policy can all exist independently of worker well-being. I remain doubtful, therefore, as to whether being ‘able to take as much holiday as they want’ is either the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) He is using his daughter to make a planned change appear more acceptable.",

The passage questions the practicality and potential negative impacts of such a policy.\n\n2. **Contextual Analysis**:\n   - The founder claims the idea came from his daughter's email.\n   - The multinational corporation has 50,000 employees, indicating a large scale operation.\n   - The passage mentions that the idea is inspired by an internet company with 2,000 employees and a single service, implying a different context.\n   - The multinational corporation is described as having diverse operations in multiple sectors (financial services, transport, healthcare).\n\n3. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **(A) He is unwise to employ his daughter in his company.**\n     - This option doesn't seem to fit the context provided. The passage does not suggest any issues with employing his daughter.\n   - **(B) He is dishonestly copying an idea from another company.**\n     - While the idea came from his daughter, the passage doesn't imply dishonesty or copying. It's more about the appropriateness of the policy.\n   - **(C) He is using his daughter to make a planned change appear more acceptable.**\n     - This aligns well with the passage. The founder is introducing a new policy that seems to be inspired by his daughter's email, suggesting he is using her input to make the change seem more acceptable.\n   - **(D) He is merely trying to increase his personal popularity.**\n     - This option isn't directly supported by the passage. There's no indication of the founder trying to increase his personal popularity.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate option is **(C)**: He is using his daughter to make a planned change appear more acceptable.\n\nFinal Answer: (C) He is using his daughter to make a planned change appear more acceptable.",

The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy. According to the founder of the multinational corporation, the idea came to him via a cheery email (reproduced in many newspapers) from his daughter. In it she sounds suspiciously like a copywriter from her father’s media team. Setting aside the fact that the means by which the announcement was made seems like a hollow attempt at ‘humanising’ what may turn out to be a less than generous policy decision, let us ask: is the idea practical?\nThe internet company and the multinational corporation are fundamentally distinct – the former has 2,000 employees and provides a single service, while the latter has 50,000 employees with dozens of subsidiary companies providing services as diverse as financial services, transport, and healthcare. The approach of ‘take as much time off as you want as long as you’re sure it won’t damage the business’ seems better suited to a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules, and so may be more comfortable in assessing whether their absence would harm the business – in any case a problematically abstract notion.\nThe founder of the multinational has stated that his employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they ‘feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business –  or, for that matter, their careers.’ Is it possible to be that sure? No matter how many loose ends you manage to tie up in advance of a holiday, there is always a mountain of work to come back to. That is simply the nature of leave; you put your work on hold, but its accumulation is inevitable and beyond your control. Someone who follows these guidelines would likely not go at all, or, at the very least, would feel overly guilty about going. Increased levels of guilt lead to stress and this, together with workers not taking sufficient leave, would lead to a decrease in productivity in the long run.\nThe situation could be compounded by pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Such pressure already affects decisions such as when to start and end the working day. Particularly in the corporate sector, there is a culture of working late, and it is easy to see how this could translate into a ‘no holiday’ culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotion. Similarly, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Essentially, they would no longer have their legal entitlement to fall back on. Perhaps then, the policy would result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave, or, they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete.\nModern technology, which allows us to receive work messages whenever and wherever we are, has blurred the distinction between work and leisure time. The internet company apparently began their unlimited leave policy when their employees asked how this new way of working could be reconciled with the company’s old-fashioned time-off policy. That is to say, if their employer was no longer able to accurately track employees’ total time on the job, why should it apply a different and outmoded standard to their time away from it? However, a potentially problematic corollary of having no set working hours is that all hours are feasibly working hours. Employees can never be sure whether or not their working hours are being monitored by their employer, causing them to internalise this scrutiny and become self-disciplining, with possibly destructive effects. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity and productivity which are cited as the desired results of the unlimited leave policy can all exist independently of worker well-being.

        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's break down the reference passage and the options to find the correct answer:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Context\nThe passage discusses the implementation of an \"unlimited leave\" policy in two different types of companies: a multinational corporation and an internet company. The core of the passage is to compare these two companies and draw a conclusion about the suitability of the unlimited leave policy in each.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Differences\n- **Multinational Corporation**: Has 50,000 employees across various subsidiaries providing diverse services.\n- **Internet Company**: Has 2,000 employees providing a single service.\n\n### Step 3: Examine the Policy Implementation\n- The multinational corporation adopted the unlimited leave policy based on an email from its daughter, who worked for an internet company.\n- The internet company implemented the policy due to modern technology allowing flexible work arrangements.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Suitability of the Policy\n- The passage argues that the unlimited leave policy might be more suitable for the smaller, more focused internet company compared to the larger, more diverse multinational corporation.\n- It suggests that in the multinational corporation, the policy could lead to increased stress, guilt, and reduced productivity due to the complexity and diversity of the work environment.\n\n### Step 5: Consider Each Option\n- **(A) Unlimited leave is more likely to work in a more diverse company.**\n  - This contradicts the passage. The passage argues the opposite.\n  \n- **(B) Employees in a smaller company have more loyalty to each other.**\n  - The passage does not discuss employee loyalty; it focuses on the differences in company structure and the impact of the policy.\n\n- **(C) It is difficult for workers to assess what is best for their company.**\n  - While the passage mentions challenges in assessing the impact of leave, it does not suggest that it is difficult for workers to determine what is best for their company overall.\n\n- **(D) What works in one company may be unsuitable for another.**\n  - This aligns with the main argument of the passage. The passage clearly states that the unlimited leave policy that works well in the smaller internet company may not be suitable for the larger, more complex multinational corporation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is **(D) What works in one company may be unsuitable for another.**",

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer the reading comprehension question, let's carefully analyze the passage and the options provided:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Context and Core Question**:\n   - The passage discusses a multinational corporation and an internet company both implementing policies allowing employees to take unlimited leave.\n   - The writer is comparing these two companies to illustrate a broader point.\n\n2. **Understand the Passage**:\n   - The multinational corporation with 50,000 employees has multiple subsidiaries, providing diverse services.\n   - The internet company with 2,000 employees focuses on a single service.\n   - Both companies are considering similar policies, but the writer argues that this approach might not be suitable for the multinational due to differences in scale and structure.\n\n3. **Core Argument**:\n   - The writer points out that the idea of unlimited leave might be better suited for a smaller company where employees know each other well and can assess the impact of their absence.\n   - The multinational corporation's employees might not have this familiarity and thus may struggle to gauge the impact of their absence on the business.\n\n4. **Evaluate Each Option**:\n\n   - **(A) Unlimited leave is more likely to work in a more diverse company**: This is not supported by the passage. The writer does not claim that diversity itself makes the policy work better.\n   \n   - **(B) Employees in a smaller company have more loyalty to each other**: While the passage mentions familiarity and assessment issues, it does not state that smaller companies inherently have more loyalty among employees.\n   \n   - **(C) It is difficult for workers to assess what is best for their company**: This aligns with the writer's argument that the multinational's employees might find it challenging to assess their absence's impact on the business due to the company's size and complexity.\n   \n   - **(D) What works in one company may be unsuitable for another**: This option fits well with the writer's argument. The passage clearly states that the policy of unlimited leave is not necessarily ideal for a large, diversified multinational corporation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the writer uses the comparison between the multinational corporation and the internet company to demonstrate that what works in one company may be unsuitable for another.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n**(D) What works in one company may be unsuitable for another.**",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "The writer compares the multinational corporation and the internet company to demonstrate that what works in one company may be unsuitable for another. The passage discusses the differences between the two types of companies, including their size, the diversity of their services, and their employee structures. It then examines the potential issues with implementing an unlimited leave policy in a multinational corporation, which is fundamentally different from the smaller, more homogenous internet company. The writer argues that the policy may not be practical or beneficial in a larger, more diverse company, and that it could lead to negative consequences such as increased stress, decreased productivity, and a culture of overwork. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) what works in one company may be unsuitable for another."

The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy. According to the founder of the multinational corporation, the idea came to him via a cheery email (reproduced in many newspapers) from his daughter. In it she sounds suspiciously like a copywriter from her father’s media team. Setting aside the fact that the means by which the announcement was made seems like a hollow attempt at ‘humanising’ what may turn out to be a less than generous policy decision, let us ask: is the idea practical?\nThe internet company and the multinational corporation are fundamentally distinct – the former has 2,000 employees and provides a single service, while the latter has 50,000 employees with dozens of subsidiary companies providing services as diverse as financial services, transport, and healthcare. The approach of ‘take as much time off as you want as long as you’re sure it won’t damage the business’ seems better suited to a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules, and so may be more comfortable in assessing whether their absence would harm the business – in any case a problematically abstract notion.\nThe founder of the multinational has stated that his employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they ‘feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business –  or, for that matter, their careers.’ Is it possible to be that sure? No matter how many loose ends you manage to tie up in advance of a holiday, there is always a mountain of work to come back to. That is simply the nature of leave; you put your work on hold, but its accumulation is inevitable and beyond your control. Someone who follows these guidelines would likely not go at all, or, at the very least, would feel overly guilty about going. Increased levels of guilt lead to stress and this, together with workers not taking sufficient leave, would lead to a decrease in productivity in the long run.\nThe situation could be compounded by pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Such pressure already affects decisions such as when to start and end the working day. Particularly in the corporate sector, there is a culture of working late, and it is easy to see how this could translate into a ‘no holiday’ culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotion. Similarly, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Essentially, they would no longer have their legal entitlement to fall back on. Perhaps then, the policy would result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave, or, they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete.\nModern technology, which allows us to receive work messages whenever and wherever we are, has blurred the distinction between work and leisure time. The internet company apparently began their unlimited leave policy when their employees asked how this new way of working could be reconciled with the company’s old-fashioned time-off policy. That is to say, if their employer was no longer able to accurately track employees’ total time on the job, why should it apply a different and outmoded standard to their time away from it? However, a potentially problematic corollary of having no set working hours is that all hours are feasibly working hours. Employees can never be sure whether or not their working hours are being monitored by their employer, causing them to internalise this scrutiny and become self-disciplining, with possibly destructive effects. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity and productivity which are cited as the desired results of the unlimited leave policy can all exist independently of worker well-being. I remain doubtful, therefore, as to whether being ‘able to take as much holiday as they want’ is either the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: C1\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) it sets unrealistic requirements for taking leave.",

The approach of ‘take as much time off as you want as long as you’re sure it won’t damage the business’ seems better suited to a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules, and so may be more comfortable in assessing whether their absence would harm the business – in any case a problematically abstract notion.\nThe founder of the multinational has stated that his employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they ‘feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business –  or, for that matter, their careers.’ Is it possible to be that sure? No matter how many loose ends you manage to tie up in advance of a holiday, there is always a mountain of work to come back to. That is simply the nature of leave; you put your work on hold, but its accumulation is inevitable and beyond your control. Someone who follows these guidelines would likely not go at all, or, at the very least, would feel overly guilty about going. Increased levels of guilt lead to stress and this, together with workers not taking sufficient leave, would lead to a decrease in productivity in the long run.\nThe situation could be compounded by pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Such pressure already affects decisions such as when to start and end the working day. Particularly in the corporate sector, there is a culture of working late, and it is easy to see how this could translate into a ‘no holiday’ culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotion. Similarly, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Essentially, they would no longer have their legal entitlement to fall back on. Perhaps then, the policy would result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave, or, they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete.\nModern technology, which allows us to receive work messages whenever and wherever we are, has blurred the distinction between work and leisure time. The internet company apparently began their unlimited leave policy when their employees asked how this new way of working could be reconciled with the company’s old-fashioned time-off policy. That is to say, if their employer was no longer able to accurately track employees’ total time on the job, why should it apply a different and outmoded standard to their time away from it? However, a potentially problematic corollary of having no set working hours is that all hours are feasibly working hours. Employees can never be sure whether or not their working hours are being monitored by their employer, causing them to internalise this scrutiny and become self-disciplining, with possibly destructive effects. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity and productivity which are cited as the desired results of the unlimited leave policy can all exist independently of worker well-being.

The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy.

Still, my wife, Marion, couldn't help but be impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've uncovered has given me pleasure - that sense of being connected to the past is one I've always found satisfying. But after the gold ring, 40 years passed before I made another discovery that impressed Marion as much. \nIt was a dull February afternoon and I had a couple of hours to spare and a location in mind. But it was raining, so I decided to to settle for a closer spot I knew to contain mainly old farming machinery. The first time my detector bleeped, I uncovered a fragment of a metal wheel. Then, as the detector swung on my arm it bleeped again. I tried to ignore it, but couldn't walk away without knowing for sure. \nI'd dug down half a metre and was on my stomach in the mud when a rounded, golden ball became visible. Having dug up brass curtain rails in the past, I tried to keep my expectations in check. But as I brushed more dirt away, the ball resolved itself into a fat, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared. Eventually, I remembered to breathe. I'd seen something like this before - the Great Torc, on display in the British Museum. It’s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain - a period over 2,000 years ago. Torc means ‘twist’ and it's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring just like the one I was looking at. \nI carried it to the car. At every junction on the drive home, I stared at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. A rinse in my kitchen sink was\nprobably the only clean the torc had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. ‘What is it?’ she said after a few moments. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery.\nNeither of us tried the torc on; the risk of damaging it was too great. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We'd never been burgled, but anxiety made me restless.  Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office and hid it underneath. The law states that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days of discovery. I was determined to enjoy the torc as much as possible before I gave it up - I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in hospital. Finally, I carried it into the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone as I placed the torc on his desk, and had his back to me. He turned, still talking, then stopped in mid-sentence. \nThe torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's currently in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself. But the torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say to me, ‘Now you've made such a fabulous find, I suppose you're going to stop detecting.’ But those brooches and coins are no less interesting now. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop - not while there's the chance of a bigger fish tomorrow. \nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) enjoys the link with history which his finds give him.

But it was raining, so I decided to to settle for a closer spot I knew to contain mainly old farming machinery. The first time my detector bleeped, I uncovered a fragment of a metal wheel. Then, as the detector swung on my arm it bleeped again. I tried to ignore it, but couldn't walk away without knowing for sure. \nI'd dug down half a metre and was on my stomach in the mud when a rounded, golden ball became visible. Having dug up brass curtain rails in the past, I tried to keep my expectations in check. But as I brushed more dirt away, the ball resolved itself into a fat, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared. Eventually, I remembered to breathe. I'd seen something like this before - the Great Torc, on display in the British Museum. It’s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain - a period over 2,000 years ago. Torc means ‘twist’ and it's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring just like the one I was looking at. \nI carried it to the car. At every junction on the drive home, I stared at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. A rinse in my kitchen sink was\nprobably the only clean the torc had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. ‘What is it?’ she said after a few moments.

The passage mentions a dull February afternoon and the author deciding to settle for a closer spot due to the weather conditions.\n\n2. **Comprehend the Question**:\n   The question asks about the author's feelings or actions during that dull February afternoon. Specifically, we need to identify which option best fits what the passage indicates about the author's state of mind or actions on that day.\n\n3. **Analyze the Options**:\n   - **Option (A)**: \"had chosen the place he was searching very carefully.\"\n     - This option does not match the passage. The passage states that the author decided to settle for a closer spot because it was raining, not because he chose the place very carefully.\n   \n   - **Option (B)**: \"almost didn’t investigate the second signal from his machine.\"\n     - This option contradicts the passage. The author did investigate the second signal, as he dug down to see what was under the metal wheel.\n   \n   - **Option (C)**: \"felt that he might find something interesting.\"\n     - This option aligns well with the passage. The author was excited and intrigued enough to dig further when the metal detector signaled again.\n   \n   - **Option (D)**: \"was anxious to stop his search because of the weather.\"\n     - This option also contradicts the passage. The author didn't stop the search because of the weather.

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's analyze the passage step by step and see which option best fits the context provided by the writer.\n\n1. The passage begins with the writer describing his first metal detector purchase and his initial success in finding a gold ring. This sets the stage for his interest in metal detecting.\n\n2. The writer then describes a dull February afternoon when he decides to use his metal detector in a location he knows to contain old farming machinery, despite the rain.\n\n3. The writer's detector beeps, and he uncovers a fragment of a metal wheel, followed by a golden ball that turns out to be the Great Torc, a famous Iron Age necklace.\n\n4. The writer carries the torc to his car, and his wife is impressed by the find. He hides the torc in their wardrobe and eventually reports it to the authorities, leading to its authentication and sale to the local council.\n\n5.

This suggests he wasn't expecting anything extraordinary.  The fact that he \"tried to keep my expectations in check\" shows he was aware that the find might not be as significant as the gold ring. \n* **The Significance:** This example emphasizes that the narrator is not blinded by excitement and is grounded in his experience.

This example involves finding a \"rounded, golden ball\" which turns out to be a \"fat, intricately patterned loop,\" identified as the Great Torc.\n\nStep 3: Recall the reference text and the question.\nThe reference text states, \"Having dug up brass curtain rails in the past, I tried to keep my expectations in check.\" The question asks what point the writer is making with the example of the brass curtain rails.\n\nStep 4: Compare the two contexts.\nIn the passage, the writer dug up brass curtain rails previously and tried to keep his expectations in check when he found the golden ball. This mirrors the situation described in the reference text where the writer expected to find valuable items but kept his expectations low due to previous experiences.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis.\nThe writer is making the point that he had already discovered some useful items there before, thus keeping his expectations low for new discoveries.

Still, my wife, Marion, couldn't help but be impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've uncovered has given me pleasure - that sense of being connected to the past is one I've always found satisfying. But after the gold ring, 40 years passed before I made another discovery that impressed Marion as much. \nIt was a dull February afternoon and I had a couple of hours to spare and a location in mind. But it was raining, so I decided to to settle for a closer spot I knew to contain mainly old farming machinery. The first time my detector bleeped, I uncovered a fragment of a metal wheel. Then, as the detector swung on my arm it bleeped again. I tried to ignore it, but couldn't walk away without knowing for sure. \nI'd dug down half a metre and was on my stomach in the mud when a rounded, golden ball became visible. Having dug up brass curtain rails in the past, I tried to keep my expectations in check. But as I brushed more dirt away, the ball resolved itself into a fat, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared. Eventually, I remembered to breathe. I'd seen something like this before - the Great Torc, on display in the British Museum. It’s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain - a period over 2,000 years ago. Torc means ‘twist’ and it's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring just like the one I was looking at. \nI carried it to the car. At every junction on the drive home, I stared at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. A rinse in my kitchen sink was\nprobably the only clean the torc had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. ‘What is it?’ she said after a few moments. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery.\nNeither of us tried the torc on; the risk of damaging it was too great. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We'd never been burgled, but anxiety made me restless.  Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office and hid it underneath. The law states that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days of discovery. I was determined to enjoy the torc as much as possible before I gave it up - I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in hospital. Finally, I carried it into the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone as I placed the torc on his desk, and had his back to me. He turned, still talking, then stopped in mid-sentence. \nThe torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's currently in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself. But the torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say to me, ‘Now you've made such a fabulous find, I suppose you're going to stop detecting.’ But those brooches and coins are no less interesting now.

I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery.\n\nIn this paragraph, Marion's reaction is described as follows: \"Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. ‘What is it?’ she said after a few moments.\"\n\nThe key detail here is that Marion stops in her tracks, which indicates a strong reaction to the find. This sudden loss of movement suggests that she is very impressed and possibly surprised by what he has discovered.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(C) her sudden loss of movement"

The most fitting option from the given choices is:\n\n(D) He was doubtful whether they would appreciate the torc’s value.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the passage to support this answer:\n\n1. The writer mentions that he had a \"couple of hours to spare\" and chose a closer location, indicating that he was not in a rush to report the find.\n2. The writer's wife, Marion, was impressed by the previous discovery of a gold ring, but the writer still took time to carefully examine and appreciate the torc before sharing it with her.\n3. The writer was concerned about the torc's condition and the risk of damaging it, as he did not try it on and hid it in the wardrobe and under a floorboard.\n4. The writer was aware of the law stating that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days of discovery, but he was determined to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up.\n5. The writer took the torc to a friend in the hospital and eventually carried it to the council office, but he did not immediately notify the authorities.\n\nThese points suggest that the writer was hesitant to report the find due to his appreciation of the torc's value and his desire to enjoy it before taking the necessary steps to officially report it. This aligns with option (D), as the writer's doubt about the authorities' appreciation of the torc's value played a role in his decision to delay notifying them. The other options (A, B, and C) are not supported by the passage.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's break down the information provided in the passage and analyze each option.\n\n1. **Identify the key information in the passage related to the question:**\n   - The writer found a significant historical artifact (the Great Torc).\n   - There is mention of a legal requirement to report such finds to the authorities within 14 days.\n   - The writer kept the torc hidden for some time before finally reporting it.\n\n2. **Analyze each option:**\n\n   (A) **He was nervous about taking the torc out of the safety of his house.**\n   - This could be partially true, but the passage does not explicitly state that he was worried about the safety of the torc outside his house. More importantly, the passage mentions hiding the torc under a floorboard in his office, indicating a deeper reason for delaying its reporting.\n\n   (B) **He was frightened of breaking the torc.**\n   - While he did not try to wear the torc, there is no indication in the passage that he feared it might break. The main concern seems to be related to its significance and the process of reporting it.\n\n   (C) **He was reluctant to part with the torc.**\n   - This is a strong candidate. The passage mentions that he wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before reporting it, which suggests a reluctance to part with it.\n\n   (D) **He was doubtful whether they would appreciate the torc’s value.**\n   - There is no evidence in the passage that he doubted the value or appreciation of the torc. In fact, he recognized its historical significance and eventually reported it to the authorities.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the analysis, the best answer is (C) He was reluctant to part with the torc. This aligns with the passage where the writer mentions wanting to enjoy the torc as much as possible before reporting it to the authorities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",

He mentions considering notifying authorities but ultimately decided not to do so.\n\n2. **Look for clues in the text**: The key sentence is: \"Finally, I carried it into the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone as I placed the torc on his desk, and had his back to me. He turned, still talking, then stopped in mid-sentence.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the implications**: The passage indicates that the registrar turned to speak with someone else as the writer placed the torc on the desk.

And be honest.’ Mia picked up a medium-sized brimmed hat that was softened with a pretty layer of gauze and trimmed with a silk bow, ‘I still think this one suited you best,’ she said to her customer with well-practised diplomacy.\nWrinkling her nose, the woman scrunched up her face, giving herself the unfortunate appearance of a bulldog. ‘But it is so boring,’ she said. ‘Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. Whereas this little beauty will make me stand out from the crowd. Sighing, she patted the red and black miniature top hat that was perched at a jaunty angle on her head. ‘Yes,’ she said decisively, ‘this is the one I want.’\nMia knew when she was beaten and with a smile firmly in place and agreeing that the woman would indeed stand out from the crowd at her daughter’s wedding, she thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together.\nIt was a while since she’d managed to get everyone in the same place and she was looking forward to seeing Jen and Dan and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her. A friend they knew nothing about, as her husband Jeff had been only too quick to point out when Jen had phoned last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ‘Tattie,’ Jeff had said in response to Mia relaying the news, ‘What sort of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana’, Mia had replied. ‘I think it’s nice.’ ‘More like something very affected,’ Jeff retorted.\nHer husband had no time for affectation or anything of an ostentatious nature. Nor did he believe in ‘pussyfooting about’, as he called Mia’s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have held back with this woman in the shop: he would have come right out with the truth and informed her that she was choosing the wrong hat. Moreover, he probably would have said that a dustbin lid would flatter her more. ‘The trouble with you, Mia,’ he regularly said, ‘is that you’re much too polite for your own good.’ \nAn hour later Mia had shut up shop and was letting herself in at the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work took all of forty seconds. Four years ago when Luke, the youngest of their children, had left home, Mia had had the idea of converting the unused barn to the side of the house into a light and airy space from which she could run her own business, Jeff had been sceptical. ‘You really think the demand for hats is out there?’ he’d asked. Mia knew, from listening to friends bemoaning the difficulty of tracking down the perfect hat to complete an outfit for a special occasion, that the demand was most definitely there.\nShe was proved right. From day one, after Jen had helped her to create a website to promote the business, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from miles around to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham where, in a relaxed and welcoming environment, she gave them the opportunity to try on as many hats as it took to find what they were looking for. With changing rooms on offer, she encouraged her customers to bring their outfits with them so that nothing was left to chance. She had recently extended the service and started selling handbags and costume jewellery as well.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) She is used to situations like this.",

She has a showroom in Little Pelham and encourages customers to try on hats and bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match.\n\nFrom the given options, the most accurate answer is:\n\n(D) She is keen to show off her good taste.\n\nThis is because Mia's diplomatic approach in suggesting hats to her customers and her successful business indicate that she has a good taste in hats and is skilled at helping others find the right hat for their needs.

And be honest.’ Mia picked up a medium-sized brimmed hat that was softened with a pretty layer of gauze and trimmed with a silk bow, ‘I still think this one suited you best,’ she said to her customer with well-practised diplomacy.\nWrinkling her nose, the woman scrunched up her face, giving herself the unfortunate appearance of a bulldog. ‘But it is so boring,’ she said. ‘Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. Whereas this little beauty will make me stand out from the crowd. Sighing, she patted the red and black miniature top hat that was perched at a jaunty angle on her head. ‘Yes,’ she said decisively, ‘this is the one I want.’\nMia knew when she was beaten and with a smile firmly in place and agreeing that the woman would indeed stand out from the crowd at her daughter’s wedding, she thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together.\nIt was a while since she’d managed to get everyone in the same place and she was looking forward to seeing Jen and Dan and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her. A friend they knew nothing about, as her husband Jeff had been only too quick to point out when Jen had phoned last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ‘Tattie,’ Jeff had said in response to Mia relaying the news, ‘What sort of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana’, Mia had replied. ‘I think it’s nice.’ ‘More like something very affected,’ Jeff retorted.\nHer husband had no time for affectation or anything of an ostentatious nature. Nor did he believe in ‘pussyfooting about’, as he called Mia’s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have held back with this woman in the shop: he would have come right out with the truth and informed her that she was choosing the wrong hat. Moreover, he probably would have said that a dustbin lid would flatter her more. ‘The trouble with you, Mia,’ he regularly said, ‘is that you’re much too polite for your own good.’ \nAn hour later Mia had shut up shop and was letting herself in at the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work took all of forty seconds. Four years ago when Luke, the youngest of their children, had left home, Mia had had the idea of converting the unused barn to the side of the house into a light and airy space from which she could run her own business, Jeff had been sceptical. ‘You really think the demand for hats is out there?’ he’d asked. Mia knew, from listening to friends bemoaning the difficulty of tracking down the perfect hat to complete an outfit for a special occasion, that the demand was most definitely there.\nShe was proved right. From day one, after Jen had helped her to create a website to promote the business, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from miles around to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham where, in a relaxed and welcoming environment, she gave them the opportunity to try on as many hats as it took to find what they were looking for. With changing rooms on offer, she encouraged her customers to bring their outfits with them so that nothing was left to chance. She had recently extended the service and started selling handbags and costume jewellery as well.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) the hat Mia is holding",

        "Phi35MiniInst_answer": "In line 5, \"It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together,\" the pronoun 'it' refers to the event or occasion being described. Here, 'it' is not directly pointing to a specific object like a hat or a choice but rather to the situation of Jen's thirtieth birthday and the family gathering. Therefore, none of the given options (A, B, C, D) directly match the context of 'it' in this line. However, if we must choose the closest option, it would be:\n\n(C) having to wear a hat\n\nThis is because the context of the passage revolves around hats and Jen's birthday, and 'it' could be loosely associated with the idea of Jen potentially wearing a hat for her special occasion. But it's important to note that this is not a direct reference and the question might be misleading. The most accurate interpretation of 'it' in this context is the birthday celebration itself.",

We need to identify what 'it' might be referring to based on the context.\n\n4. **Consider the options**:\n   - (A) the hat Mia is holding: This doesn't fit because the sentence talks about getting people together and looking forward to seeing family members, not about a hat.\n   - (B) choosing the right hat: While Mia is helping choose a hat, the sentence is not specifically about this action.\n   - (C) having to wear a hat: This option doesn't align with the content of the sentence.\n   - (D) the hat the customer is wearing: The sentence is about Mia managing to gather her family, not about the customer's hat.\n\n5. **Examine the full sentence**: \"It was a while since she’d managed to get everyone in the same place and she was looking forward to seeing Jen and Dan and Luke.\" Here, 'it' is likely referring to the act of gathering her family, as the rest of the sentence focuses on her anticipation of seeing her children and her daughter's friend.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, 'it' refers to the fact that it has been a while since Mia managed to get everyone in the same place.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not among the given options.

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the passage and analyze the context surrounding Jeff's statement.\n\nFirstly, the passage discusses Mia's daughter Jen and her plans to attend her daughter's wedding. Mia is trying to help Jen choose a hat for the event, but Jen has brought along a friend named Tatiana (referred to as Tattie). \n\nJeff, Mia's husband, expresses his opinion on the name \"Tattie\" when Jen mentions bringing Tatiana over. Here's a close look at the relevant part:\n\n\"Wrinkling her nose, the woman scrunched up her face, giving herself the unfortunate appearance of a bulldog. 'But it is so boring,' she said. 'Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter's wedding. Whereas this little beauty will make me stand out from the crowd. Sighing, she patted the red and black miniature top hat that was perched at a jaunty angle on her head. 'Yes,' she said decisively, 'this is the one I want.'\"\n\nMia then turns to her husband Jeff and says, \"It's short for Tatiana\", Mia had replied. 'It's short for Tatiana', Mia had replied. 'I think it's nice.' 'More like something very affected', Jeff retorted.\n\nThe key phrase here is Jeff's retort: \"More like something very affected\". This indicates that Jeff is expressing disapproval of the name \"Tattie\" (or \"Tatiana\"). He is suggesting that the name seems pretentious or overly fancy.\n\nGiven the options provided, we need to identify which one aligns with Jeff's implied sentiment:\n\n(A) He doesn’t understand the meaning of the name.\n- This isn't correct because Jeff does understand the name; he just doesn't like it.\n\n(B) He dislikes his daughter’s new friend.\n- While Jeff may dislike the name, this option doesn't capture the essence of his comment. He specifically dislikes the name rather than the person.\n\n(C) He can’t remember meeting Tatiana.\n- This is not mentioned anywhere in the passage and is unrelated to Jeff's comment.\n\n(D) He disapproves of the name.\n- This is the closest option. Jeff clearly states that he thinks the name is \"very affected\" or \"affected\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D): Jeff disapproves of the name.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "Jeff is implying (D) he disapproves of the name when he says, ‘What sort of name is that?’ in line 16. This is because he immediately follows his question with a negative comment, saying, ‘More like something very affected,’ indicating his disapproval of the name. He also expresses his dislike for affectation and ostentatious things, which further supports the idea that he disapproves of the name."

She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her. A friend they knew nothing about, as her husband Jeff had been only too quick to point out when Jen had phoned last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ‘Tattie,’ Jeff had said in response to Mia relaying the news, ‘What sort of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana’, Mia had replied. ‘I think it’s nice.’ ‘More like something very affected,’ Jeff retorted.\nHer husband had no time for affectation or anything of an ostentatious nature.

        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant information**: We need to focus on the fifth paragraph, which starts with \"An hour later Mia had shut up shop...\"\n\n2. **Understand Mia's context**: Mia has just finished her workday and is going home. She mentions her husband, Jeff, and his attitudes towards her and their daughter Jen.\n\n3. **Analyze Jeff's comments**:\n   - Jeff is described as having no time for \"affectation\" or \"ostentatious\" things.\n   - He doesn't believe in being \"too polite\" and often speaks his mind.\n   - When Jen mentioned bringing a friend named Tatiana to the family gathering, Jeff criticized the name.\n\n4. **Interpret Mia's reaction**: Mia is aware of how Jeff would react to the situation.

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's analyze the passage step by step and see which option aligns with the information provided.\n\n1. The passage begins with Mia discussing a hat with a customer, but it quickly shifts to Mia thinking about her daughter Jen's birthday and her family gathering.\n2. Mia's husband, Jeff, is described as someone who is not very supportive of Mia's ideas and is skeptical about her business plans.\n3. The passage then mentions that four years ago, Mia had the idea of converting an unused barn into a space to run her own business, but Jeff was skeptical about the demand for hats.\n4. Despite Jeff's skepticism, Mia was proven right when her business, Mia’s Hats, became a success after she created a website with her daughter Jen's help.\n5. The passage ends by mentioning that Mia’s Hats is a success and that she has extended her services to include handbags and costume jewelry.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\n(A) become bored with listening to her friends’ complaints.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of Mia being bored with her friends' complaints.\n\n(B) wanted to show her husband that he was mistaken.\n- This option is partially supported. Jeff was skeptical about the demand for hats, and Mia's business success could be seen as a way to show him that he was mistaken.\n\n(C) come up with a plan which she felt had a good prospect of working.\n- This option is supported by the passage. Mia had the idea of converting the barn into a business space, and despite Jeff's skepticism, she went ahead with it, which suggests she believed in the potential of her plan.\n\n(D) been able to use the space previously occupied by her youngest child.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. The passage mentions the barn being converted into a business space, but it does not specify that it was previously occupied by her youngest child.\n\nBased on the passage, the most supported reason why Mia set up her own business is (C) come up with a plan which she felt had a good prospect of working. This is because the passage describes Mia's initial idea and her belief in the potential of her business, despite her husband's skepticism. Option (B) is also partially supported, but (C) is more directly related to the information provided in the passage."

And be honest.’ Mia picked up a medium-sized brimmed hat that was softened with a pretty layer of gauze and trimmed with a silk bow, ‘I still think this one suited you best,’ she said to her customer with well-practised diplomacy.\nWrinkling her nose, the woman scrunched up her face, giving herself the unfortunate appearance of a bulldog. ‘But it is so boring,’ she said. ‘Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. Whereas this little beauty will make me stand out from the crowd. Sighing, she patted the red and black miniature top hat that was perched at a jaunty angle on her head. ‘Yes,’ she said decisively, ‘this is the one I want.’\nMia knew when she was beaten and with a smile firmly in place and agreeing that the woman would indeed stand out from the crowd at her daughter’s wedding, she thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together.\nIt was a while since she’d managed to get everyone in the same place and she was looking forward to seeing Jen and Dan and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her. A friend they knew nothing about, as her husband Jeff had been only too quick to point out when Jen had phoned last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ‘Tattie,’ Jeff had said in response to Mia relaying the news, ‘What sort of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana’, Mia had replied. ‘I think it’s nice.’ ‘More like something very affected,’ Jeff retorted.\nHer husband had no time for affectation or anything of an ostentatious nature. Nor did he believe in ‘pussyfooting about’, as he called Mia’s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have held back with this woman in the shop: he would have come right out with the truth and informed her that she was choosing the wrong hat. Moreover, he probably would have said that a dustbin lid would flatter her more. ‘The trouble with you, Mia,’ he regularly said, ‘is that you’re much too polite for your own good.’ \nAn hour later Mia had shut up shop and was letting herself in at the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work took all of forty seconds. Four years ago when Luke, the youngest of their children, had left home, Mia had had the idea of converting the unused barn to the side of the house into a light and airy space from which she could run her own business, Jeff had been sceptical. ‘You really think the demand for hats is out there?’ he’d asked. Mia knew, from listening to friends bemoaning the difficulty of tracking down the perfect hat to complete an outfit for a special occasion, that the demand was most definitely there.\nShe was proved right. From day one, after Jen had helped her to create a website to promote the business, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from miles around to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham where, in a relaxed and welcoming environment, she gave them the opportunity to try on as many hats as it took to find what they were looking for. With changing rooms on offer, she encouraged her customers to bring their outfits with them so that nothing was left to chance.

If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him. His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C.  Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’\nHe is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’\n‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\n‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’\nNow Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) Becoming a cameraman suited the interests he already had.",

'I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.'\"\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that Allan was initially given the opportunity to work as a cameraman by a TV crew that he encountered while he was working in Antarctica.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n(A) This option states that Allan had to train as a diver to become a wildlife cameraman, which is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n(B) This option suggests that Allan's interest in wildlife suited his role as a cameraman, which aligns with the passage. The text indicates that Allan took the TV crew to different places and realized that being a wildlife cameraman aligned with his travel, adventure, and underwater interests. Thus, this option seems plausible.\n(C) This option incorrectly implies that Allan was given the chance to work as a cameraman by meeting a TV crew in Antarctica. While this is true, it doesn't capture the essence of the learning point from the passage.\n(D) This option suggests that finding work as a cameraman allowed him to remain in Antarctica. The passage does not indicate that Allan stayed in Antarctica due to his work as a cameraman; rather, it explains how he was introduced to the job by a TV crew.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Becoming a cameraman suited the interests he already had.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's break down the first paragraph of the passage and analyze the information provided about Allan:\n\n1. \"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places.\"\n2. \"If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him.\"\n3. \"His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C.\"\n4. \"Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver.\"\n5. \"Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places.\"\n6. \"His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary.\"\n7. \"‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’\"\n\nFrom these points, we can gather the following information about Allan:\n- He is a wildlife cameraman who films in cold places.\n- He has a passion for diving and learned about survival in cold places.\n- He got his big break when a TV crew came to Antarctica to film a wildlife documentary, and he took them to different places.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options given:\n\n(A) He had to train as a diver in order to become a wildlife cameraman.\n- The passage mentions that Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver, but it does not explicitly state that he had to train as a diver to become a wildlife cameraman. This option is not directly supported by the passage.\n\n(B) Becoming a cameraman suited the interests he already had.\n- The passage does not provide enough information to conclude that becoming a cameraman was solely because it suited his interests. It focuses more on his passion for diving and the opportunity that came his way.\n\n(C) He was given the chance to work as a cameraman by a TV crew he met.\n- The passage states that Allan's big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. This option is supported by the passage.\n\n(D) Finding work as a cameraman allowed him to remain in Antarctica.\n- The passage does not mention that Allan found work as a cameraman to remain in Antarctica. It only mentions that he got a big break while working in Antarctica.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, the best answer is (C) He was given the chance to work as a cameraman by a TV crew he met."

If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him. His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C.  Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’\nHe is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’\n‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\n‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’\nNow Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (B) Most of what he filmed was new to viewers.",

His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’\nHe is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’\n‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\n‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’\nNow Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) be more hopeful that one bear would lead him to others.",

The passage mentions that Allan was in Kong Karls Land, a place known for its polar bears and harsh conditions.\n2. After spending 23 days watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub.\n3. On day 24, Allan says he was living in the bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\n4. He describes a thrilling moment when he finally spots a bear, and it quickly becomes clear that the bear is not bothered by his presence.\n5. The passage then describes how the mother bear and her cubs explore the world outside the den, giving Allan a unique opportunity to observe and film their behavior.\n6. The passage concludes with Allan's desire to make a documentary about climate change in the Arctic, using his experiences in Kong Karls Land.\n\nFrom these points, it's evident that Allan's experience in Kong Karls Land led him to be more hopeful that one bear would lead him to others, as he was able to observe and film the mother bear and her cubs exploring the world outside the den.

He expresses his amazement and excitement at being in the right place at the right time to film such a remarkable moment. The other options (A, B, and D) are not mentioned in this particular paragraph.",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to focus on the fifth paragraph of the passage. The relevant paragraph starts with \"Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic...\"\n\n2. This paragraph doesn't directly relate to the feeling described in the question. So, we need to go back and carefully read the fourth paragraph, as it contains the fifth paragraph's context.\n\n3. The fourth paragraph ends with: \"By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\"\n\n4. The fifth paragraph begins: \"We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm.\"\n\n5. Then, the paragraph describes a thrilling encounter with a polar bear: \"Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it... When she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I'd swear it's partly in sheer pleasure,' he recounts...\"\n\n6. From the description of the encounter, especially the phrase \"I'd swear it's partly in sheer pleasure,\" we can infer that Allan felt a strong sense of excitement and joy during this experience.\n\n7. Now, let's match this inference with the given options:\n   (A) panic - This doesn't fit the description.\n   (B) concern - While there might have been some concern, it's not the main feeling described.\n   (C) amazement - This fits well with the description of the encounter.\n   (D) delight - This also fits the description, especially the phrase \"sheer pleasure.\"\n\n8. Between options C and D, both are strong choices, but \"delight\" is a more direct synonym for the \"sheer pleasure\" mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) his delight at being able to move around after waiting quietly for ages. This option best captures the overall feeling of excitement and joy that Allan experienced during the encounter with the polar bear.",

It then provides an example: \"Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\"\n3. The context here is Allan describing a failed attempt to film something he couldn't identify.\n\nGiven this analysis, the emotion Allan describes in the fifth paragraph is disappointment or embarrassment due to a failure in his mission to film successfully. \n\nNow, let's compare this to the options provided:\n\n(A) his panic when he nearly fails to film a fantastic sequence\n- This option suggests panic, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the text. The text only mentions a failure (\"Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were\"), not panic.\n\n(B) his concern that he has disturbed an adult female with her young\n- This option talks about disturbing an animal, but the text doesn't mention anything about disturbing an adult female with her young.\n\n(C) his amazement at being lucky enough to capture some great shots\n- This option suggests excitement or amazement, which isn't described in the paragraph. The text describes a failed attempt rather than a successful one.\n\n(D) his delight at being able to move around after waiting quietly for ages\n- This option implies a positive feeling from a long wait, but the paragraph focuses on a failed attempt rather than a pleasant experience.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the closest description of Allan's feeling in the fifth paragraph is disappointment or embarrassment due to a failure, which aligns best with option (A).\n\nFinal answer: (A) his panic when he nearly fails to film a fantastic sequence",

        "processed_text": "What does it refer to in line 41?\nOptions:\n(A) Allan’s film\n(B) climate change\n(C) the Arctic\n(D) living there\nReference Passage: Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him. His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C.  Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’\nHe is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’\n‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\n‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’\nNow Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand.

It was noted that her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Intrigued journalists quizzed her on the benefits of a wonderful natural treatment, emu oil. This was a product Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended, to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training.\nRadcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race. And Hartmann was actually infuriated at this, although he admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was would be thinking it was a risk starting off so fast.\nWith 800m left to run Radcliffe began to calculate. It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking ‘I can run quicker than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.’ Regrettably that was not to be.\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, “I can relax back,” it was always: “keep hitting it as hard as you can.”\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak. She would never run as fast again. She did, however, leave a lasting legacy. Many women were inspired to take up long-distance running.\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) wondered whether a product had helped Radcliffe perform so well.",

It was noted that her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Intrigued journalists quizzed her on the benefits of a wonderful natural treatment, emu oil. This was a product Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended, to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training.\nRadcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race. And Hartmann was actually infuriated at this, although he admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was would be thinking it was a risk starting off so fast.\nWith 800m left to run Radcliffe began to calculate. It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking ‘I can run quicker than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.’ Regrettably that was not to be.\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, “I can relax back,” it was always: “keep hitting it as hard as you can.”\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak. She would never run as fast again. She did, however, leave a lasting legacy.

This shows strong disagreement with the agent's concern and indicates that Radcliffe was running at a very fast pace.\n\n4. **Radcliffe's Performance:** Despite the initial doubts and concerns, Radcliffe maintained her pace and completed the race in under 2 hours and 16 minutes, setting a new personal best.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Some were unsure whether she was in good enough condition.\n   - This aligns with the agent questioning her ability to keep up the pace, suggesting some uncertainty.\n\n(B) Some feared she had started off running much too quickly.\n   - This is supported by the statement that Gerard Hartmann was \"infuriated\" at the suggestion of a fast start.\n\n(C) One of them was convinced that she would not complete the run.\n   - There is no indication that any member of her support team believed she wouldn't complete the run.\n\n(D) One of them was confident that she could maintain her speed.\n   - This contradicts the concerns expressed by the agent and Hartmann.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage, the most accurate description of how Radcliffe's support team reacted during the race is that some were unsure whether she was in good enough condition, and some feared she had started off running much too quickly.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) Some were unsure whether she was in good enough condition.",

It was noted that her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Intrigued journalists quizzed her on the benefits of a wonderful natural treatment, emu oil. This was a product Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended, to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training.\nRadcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race. And Hartmann was actually infuriated at this, although he admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was would be thinking it was a risk starting off so fast.\nWith 800m left to run Radcliffe began to calculate. It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking ‘I can run quicker than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.’ Regrettably that was not to be.\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, “I can relax back,” it was always: “keep hitting it as hard as you can.”\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak. She would never run as fast again. She did, however, leave a lasting legacy.

The passage mentions that Radcliffe managed to finish the race in 2 minutes 25 seconds for the last 800 meters, which was faster than her initial prediction of finishing in under 2 hours 16 minutes.\n\n2. Radcliffe had thought she could come back and achieve this time again, but unfortunately, that was not to be.\n\n3. The writer describes Radcliffe's thoughts and feelings during the race, including her disappointment that she couldn't achieve her goal of coming back and breaking her own record.\n\n4. The other options (A, B, and D) are not supported by the passage. There is no mention of Radcliffe feeling sad about not achieving her wish (A), surprised at her ability to plan the final stage in such detail (B), or annoyed by Dave Bedford's prediction (D).\n\n5. The passage concludes that Radcliffe's marathon was her career peak, and she would never run as fast again, which further emphasizes the disappointment she felt about not achieving her goal.\n\nIn summary, the writer's tone when describing the end of Radcliffe's race is best described as disappointed by the actual timing of the last 800 meters (Option C).",
        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's analyze the reference passage step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant part of the text**: The key part to focus on is the last sentence of the passage which mentions Radcliffe's thoughts after the race: \"And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.'\n\n2. **Analyze the options**:\n   - **(A) sad that she did not achieve her wish to break her own record again**: The passage does not mention any sadness or disappointment about not breaking her own record again.\n   - **(B) surprised at her ability to plan the final stage in such detail**: There is no indication in the passage that Radcliffe was surprised by her planning skills.\n   - **(C) disappointed by the actual timing of the last 800 metres**: While the passage mentions Radcliffe's thoughts about coming back and doing it again, it doesn't specifically state that she was disappointed by the actual timing of the last 800 meters.\n   - **(D) annoyed by Dave Bedford’s unwise prediction**: The passage states, \"I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.' This indicates that Radcliffe was confident she would be able to run even faster in the future.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (D) annoyed by Dave Bedford’s unwise prediction. Radcliffe's statement shows confidence and a belief that she could achieve even better results, suggesting she was not annoyed by Bedford's prediction but rather confident in her abilities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **(D)**.",

        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this question, let's carefully analyze the passage and the reference text step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Information\nThe question asks about the writer's tone when describing the end of Radcliffe’s race. The key information comes from the passage which states:\n\n\"Regrettably that was not to be.\" \nThis indicates disappointment, suggesting that Radcliffe did not achieve her goal.\n\nAdditionally, we find:\n\"At the finish, she recalls thinking 'I can run quicker than that,' she says. 'I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while.' And I was thinking, \"I'm going to come back and do it next year\" I really did think I would.'\n\nThese lines indicate Radcliffe's excitement and belief that she could run faster in the future.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Writer's Tone\nThe passage is written from a third-person perspective, likely by a journalist or someone reporting on the event. The description of Radcliffe's thoughts and actions suggest a mix of surprise and disappointment.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Tone to the Options\nLet's examine each option in light of our analysis:\n\n- **Option A:** Sad that she did not achieve her wish to break her own record again.\n  - This aligns with the disappointment expressed, but it doesn't capture the surprise element.\n  \n- **Option B:** Surprised at her ability to plan the final stage in such detail.\n  - This isn't mentioned in the passage. The focus is on the outcome rather than her planning ability.\n  \n- **Option C:** Disappointed by the actual timing of the last 800 meters.\n  - This captures the disappointment but also misses the element of surprise.\n  \n- **Option D:** Annoyed by Dave Bedford's unwise prediction.\n  - This isn't discussed in the passage at all. The writer's tone isn't specifically about Bedford's prediction.\n  \n### Conclusion\nThe most fitting option is **Option C**. The passage suggests a mix of disappointment that she didn't break her own record and surprise that she came so close. The writer seems to convey a sense of disappointment with the outcome, despite her excitement about potentially doing better next time.\n\nTherefore, the writer sounds **(C) disappointed by the actual timing of the last 800 metres.**",

That's what made her so good.'\"\n\nFrom this description, we can infer that Hartmann believes Radcliffe's success is due to the extreme effort and dedication she put into her training, which included pushing herself to the brink of physical exhaustion. The phrase \"extract that last ounce out of you\" indicates that Radcliffe was able to push herself to levels that others couldn't, even after being pushed beyond normal limits.\n\nNext, consider the following statement from Hartmann:\n\n\"I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.\"\n\nThis further supports the idea that Radcliffe's success came from her ability to endure immense physical pain and stress during her training sessions.\n\nFinally, consider the quote from Radcliffe herself regarding her approach to racing:\n\n\"I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.\"\n\nWhile Radcliffe acknowledges her own hard work, she attributes her success to a combination of factors including her own efforts and the competitive environment. However, when asked about the secret of her success, she points to the mental aspect of never relaxing and always pushing herself to her limits.\n\nGiven these insights, we can conclude that Hartmann thinks the secret of Radcliffe's success lies in her ability to tolerate physical suffering. This aligns best with option (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) her ability to tolerate physical suffering.",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To determine what Hartmann thinks is the secret of Radcliffe’s success, we need to carefully analyze the reference passage provided.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant part of the passage:**\n   - Hartmann describes his work with Radcliffe: \"He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\"\n\n2. **Analyze Hartmann's statement:**\n   - Hartmann mentions that Radcliffe could endure a lot of pain and that he had to go deep into her muscles, which caused him significant discomfort. This indicates that Radcliffe's ability to tolerate physical suffering was a key factor in her success.\n\n3. **Match the analysis with the given options:**\n   - (A) her particular style of running: The passage does not focus on Radcliffe's running style as the secret to her success.\n   - (B) her ability to tolerate physical suffering: Hartmann's statement about enduring pain and the physical toll it took on him supports this option.\n   - (C) the distances she ran regularly in training: While training distances are mentioned, Hartmann's focus is on the pain and physical suffering Radcliffe endured.\n   - (D) the special treatment she had after each run: Hartmann does not mention any special treatment as the secret to her success.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n(B) her ability to tolerate physical suffering."

It was noted that her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Intrigued journalists quizzed her on the benefits of a wonderful natural treatment, emu oil. This was a product Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended, to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training.\nRadcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race. And Hartmann was actually infuriated at this, although he admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was would be thinking it was a risk starting off so fast.\nWith 800m left to run Radcliffe began to calculate. It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking ‘I can run quicker than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.’ Regrettably that was not to be.\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, “I can relax back,” it was always: “keep hitting it as hard as you can.”\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak. She would never run as fast again. She did, however, leave a lasting legacy.

Radcliffe's husband and coach, Gary Lough, and her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, were involved in her training and were aware of the intensity and dedication required to achieve her record.\n4. Hartmann worked with Radcliffe for weeks, providing daily sessions to counter the extensive training she was undergoing.\n5. Radcliffe mentioned that she trained really hard and believed that her mental approach of never letting off the gas played a significant role in her record-setting performance.\n6. Radcliffe also mentioned that there are people out there who are more talented, which could be a reason why no one has come close to her record.\n\nBased on this information, the most appropriate answer to the question is:\n\n(C) they have the personal drive that is required.\n\nRadcliffe's statement about the mental way of never letting off the gas and the dedication required to achieve her record suggests that she believes the personal drive and mental approach are crucial factors that others may lack. This aligns with option (C)."

Then one guy, David, who’d had some experience of freestyle ski-jumping, and presumably wanted to preserve his reputation as someone who knew exactly what he was doing, soon pushed forward, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Even to our untutored eyes, something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth then kindly informed us, ‘speed is an unpredictable beast.’\nPerhaps I just wasn’t cut out for this freestyle stuff. On previous skiing holidays, I’d enjoyed messing about, practising turns in the snow. I just wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. Deep down, I'd always thought it looked fun, but reckoned that, with my lack of know-how, if I’d tried to join with the skateboarders, with their baggy trousers and special language, I’d have risked total ridicule.\nThen my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, from which students leapt, shrieking attempted their new tricks, then landed in pits of foam cubes –  hardly a realistic introduction to what lay ahead of us out on the slopes. After practising their moves indoors, students headed outside to try them for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan cheerily assured us. ‘Before places like this trained people up, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’\nThe ‘knuckle’ Gareth was referring to is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again to become the landing zone proper.  Land in the zone and your motion continues forward, minimising impact. Land on the flat and you stop dead, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, though, it was all but impossible to convince my body to ignore what my brain was screaming at me and to race straight towards the jump. My legs would virtually go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came slamming down onto the knuckle. I managed not to fall but by midday I felt several centimetres shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. \nDay two started on the trampolines in the centre. I'd expected to hate being stuck indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some of the drills copied moves we’d make while ski-jumping, others were aimed at teaching ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in space. Gareth gave us a running commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ apparently needed work – and it’s true that, every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and nothing more until I found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.\nWe moved back to the mountain to try again. Inevitably, there were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as delighted as me, and for a few moments I was walking on air, with the sheer pride of having achieved such an elusive goal. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to reduce speed as I approached the jump, became airborne,  and came down appropriately in the landing zone.

The focus is on how inexperienced skiers, including Harry, struggle with the sport.\n\n2. **Understand the situation**: Harry is part of a group of beginner skiers. David, who has some experience, takes the lead and makes a mistake, hitting the jump incorrectly and flipping head-first into the snow. \n\n3. **Analyze David's behavior**: The passage indicates that David \"had thought he would be in a more advanced group\" when he took the lead.

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's break down the passage and identify the relevant information that relates to the options provided.\n\n1. The passage describes a skiing instructor, Gareth, and his students, including David, who is an experienced freestyle ski-jumper.\n2. David attempts a jump but fails, hitting the ground and losing his skis, which Gareth comments on by saying, \"speed is an unpredictable beast.\"\n3. The passage then shifts to the narrator's perspective, who is not skilled in freestyle skiing and feels out of place among the experienced skateboarders.\n4. The narrator's parents enroll them in a training center for freestyle skiing, where Gareth emphasizes the importance of speed and progression.\n5. The narrator struggles with the jumps, initially landing on the flat section (the \"knuckle\") and then finally landing properly after several attempts.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options in the context of the passage:\n\n(A) had thought he would be in a more advanced group.\n- This option is not supported by the passage. David is described as having experience in freestyle ski-jumping, which would place him in an advanced group, not a more advanced one.\n\n(B) was a good role-model for beginners in the group.\n- The passage does not provide information about David being a role model for beginners. It only describes his own experience and struggles.\n\n(C) had not listened to the teacher’s instructions.\n- The passage does not indicate that David had not listened to Gareth's instructions. It only shows that David had a bad jump, but there is no direct evidence that he ignored Gareth's advice.\n\n(D) was not as skilled as he appeared to believe.\n- This option is supported by the passage. David, despite his experience, had a bad jump and lost his skis, which suggests that his skills may not have been as good as he thought. The passage also describes the narrator's own lack of skill and feeling out of place, which parallels David's situation.\n\nBased on the passage, the most supported answer is (D) was not as skilled as he appeared to believe. David's bad jump and the loss of his skis indicate that his actual skill level may not have matched his self-perception."

At first, though, it was all but impossible to convince my body to ignore what my brain was screaming at me and to race straight towards the jump.

Harry initially expresses a lack of confidence in his ability to participate in freestyle skiing, saying, \"Perhaps I just wasn’t cut out for this freestyle stuff.\"\n2. He describes his previous experiences as a skier, where he enjoyed practicing turns but not the freestyle tricks.\n3. Harry's parents enroll him in a training center for freestyle skiing, which he finds intimidating and unrealistic.\n4. Despite his initial fear and lack of confidence, Harry eventually starts to enjoy the trampolines and ski jumping drills at the training center.\n5. He experiences setbacks and challenges, but with Gareth's guidance, he begins to improve and land properly on the ski jumps.\n6. Harry feels a sense of pride and accomplishment when he finally lands correctly, but he also experiences a moment of fear when he notices his skis sliding down the slope.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best option that describes Harry's experience of freestyle sports is:\n\n(B) His natural ability was never fully recognised.\n\nThis option is the most accurate because Harry initially doubted his ability to participate in freestyle skiing, but through training and practice, he was able to improve and achieve success. The passage does not mention that his natural ability was never fully recognised, but rather that he had to work on his skills and overcome his fears. Options (A), (C), and (D) are not supported by the passage. Harry's fear of failure (A) is mentioned, but it is not the main focus of his experience. He does not express that his original opinion of freestylers was justified (C), and he does not regret not having developed the skills necessary to do well (D), as he actually feels a sense of pride in his achievements."

Therefore, this option is too narrow and doesn't fully capture the balance between safety and excitement.\n\n**Option (B): warned that not all students would progress at the same rate.**\n- The passage mentions that \"Progression is inevitable!\" but it also notes that some students might struggle initially. This aligns with the idea that not all students will progress at the same rate. So, this option seems plausible.\n\n**Option (C): effectively recreated the conditions students would face.**\n- The passage describes how students practice indoors and then attempt their moves outdoors, suggesting they are prepared for the real jumps. This implies the center tries to recreate the conditions students will face. Thus, this option is quite fitting.\n\n**Option (D): aimed to discourage beginners from learning by experimenting.**\n- The passage actually encourages beginners to experiment and try new things. It uses phrases like \"mess about\" and \"practicing turns in the snow,\" indicating that the center is supportive rather than discouraging. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate option is:\n\n**Option (C): effectively recreated the conditions students would face.**\n\nThis option best captures the essence of the indoor training center described in the passage.",

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's analyze the passage step by step and see which option best fits the context provided.\n\n1. The passage begins with a description of a ski jumping training session led by Gareth, the instructor. David, an experienced ski jumper, makes a mistake and falls, which Gareth uses as a learning moment for the group.\n\n2. The narrator expresses self-doubt about their ability to ski jump, comparing themselves unfavorably to the skateboarders they know.\n\n3. The narrator's parents decide to take a winter holiday at a training center for freestyle skiing in the US, where the narrator is introduced to the sport.\n\n4. Gareth explains the importance of speed in ski jumping and the dangers of landing on the flat section (the \"knuckle\") instead of the landing zone.\n\n5. The narrator struggles with the concept of speed and control, initially falling on the knuckle and feeling short by midday.\n\n6. On the second day, the narrator practices on trampolines, which helps with aerial awareness, and eventually lands properly on the mountain.\n\n7. The narrator achieves a successful jump, but then realizes their skis are sliding down the slope, indicating a loss of control.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) felt inhibited by the warning he had been given.\n- The passage does not mention the narrator feeling inhibited by a warning. The focus is on the narrator's struggle with the concept of speed and control.\n\n(B) struggled to overcome his natural instincts.\n- The passage does not specifically mention the narrator struggling with natural instincts. The struggle is more about learning to control speed and the jump.\n\n(C) showed a determination to improve his technique.\n- This option aligns with the passage, as the narrator practices on trampolines, learns about aerial awareness, and eventually lands properly, showing a determination to improve.\n\n(D) regarded the fact that he remained upright as progress.\n- The passage does not mention the narrator regarding remaining upright as progress. The focus is on the narrator's successful jump and the realization of losing control afterward.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is (C) showed a determination to improve his technique, as it is supported by the narrator's actions and experiences described in the passage."

Then one guy, David, who’d had some experience of freestyle ski-jumping, and presumably wanted to preserve his reputation as someone who knew exactly what he was doing, soon pushed forward, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Even to our untutored eyes, something was wrong. We held our breath.

It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, from which students leapt, shrieking attempted their new tricks, then landed in pits of foam cubes –  hardly a realistic introduction to what lay ahead of us out on the slopes. After practising their moves indoors, students headed outside to try them for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan cheerily assured us. ‘Before places like this trained people up, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’\nThe ‘knuckle’ Gareth was referring to is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again to become the landing zone proper.  Land in the zone and your motion continues forward, minimising impact. Land on the flat and you stop dead, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, though, it was all but impossible to convince my body to ignore what my brain was screaming at me and to race straight towards the jump.

He had to overcome his fear and learn to trust the jump.\n   - Harry eventually managed a proper landing but faced issues with the skis detaching during the descent.\n   \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While Harry did manage a good jump, the passage does not suggest he immediately excelled or felt confident about achieving perfect jumps. Instead, he experienced difficulties after the successful jump and faced a problem with the skis detaching.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate option is:\n\n**(C) got into difficulty after managing a good jump.**\n\nThis aligns with the passage where Harry successfully landed a jump but then faced an issue with his skis detaching.",

The main point is that the person is struggling to master the technique and overcome their fear of the jumps.\n\n**Analyzing the Options**\n\n* **(A) managed several surprisingly competent jumps.**  This option suggests the person was successful in their jumps, which is not what the passage describes. The passage focuses on the person's struggles and setbacks.\n* **(B) became convinced perfect jumps were impossible to achieve.** This option is a possible outcome, but the passage doesn't explicitly state this. The person is clearly trying to learn and improve.\n* **(C) got into difficulty after managing a good jump.** This option is a possible outcome, but the passage doesn't explicitly state this. The person's struggles are described in detail.\n* **(D) suffered a loss of confidence before his last jump.** This option is the most likely answer. The passage describes the person's initial fear and struggle, and the final jump is described as a moment of success followed by a setback.\n\n**Choosing the Best Answer**\n\nThe passage clearly shows the person's initial struggles and setbacks. The final jump is described as a moment of success, but it's followed by a setback. This suggests that the person experienced a loss of confidence before the final jump.\n\n**Therefore, the best answer is (D).** \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other reading comprehension questions! \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "Let's analyze the passage and the question step-by-step:\n\n1. **Context Understanding**: The passage describes Harry's experience with freestyle ski-jumping. Initially, he was unsure and experienced difficulties. He later practices indoors on trampolines and in an artificial snow-covered environment.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Information**:\n   - Harry practiced indoors first, where he learned various techniques and gained some confidence.\n   - He then went outside to try jumping on real slopes.\n   - The passage mentions his initial struggles with controlling the jump and his tendency to come down on the flat part of the jump, known as the \"knuckle.\"\n\n3. **Comprehending the Question**: The question asks about Harry's performance when he returned to the slopes after indoor practice. Specifically, we need to find the option that aligns with how well Harry performed on the slopes.\n\n4. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n   - (A) \"managed several surprisingly competent jumps.\" - This seems plausible given that Harry had indoor practice and had improved his skills.\n   - (B) \"became convinced perfect jumps were impossible to achieve.\" - This contradicts the fact that Harry did manage some jumps and gained confidence through practice.\n   - (C) \"got into difficulty after managing a good jump.\" - While Harry did have difficulties initially, this option doesn't fit the context of returning to the slopes after practice.\n   - (D) \"suffered a loss of confidence before his last jump.\" - This isn't supported by the passage; Harry seemed to gain confidence over time and even felt pride after his successful jumps.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the passage, Harry managed several jumps that were surprising and competent, especially considering his initial struggles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) \"managed several surprisingly competent jumps.\"",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's break down the passage and identify the relevant information:\n\n1. The passage describes a character named Harry who is learning freestyle skiing.\n2. Harry initially struggles with the concept of speed and control while approaching the jump.\n3. He experiences several setbacks, including falling into foam cubes and losing confidence.\n4. On the final run of the day, Harry successfully lands in the landing zone but then notices his skis sliding down the slope ahead, indicating a loss of control.\n\nGiven this information, the most appropriate answer to the question is:\n\n(D) suffered a loss of confidence before his last jump.\n\nThis option aligns with the passage's description of Harry's struggles and setbacks, culminating in a moment of loss of control during his final run. The other options do not accurately reflect the events described in the passage."

On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I’m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it’s like to be rehearsing all day long,’ she tells me. \n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. ‘A dancer who’s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They’re hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.’ \nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. ‘There may be a piece of music I’m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I’m still required to find solutions. That won’t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces – it’d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I’m always working on big productions – the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn’t negotiable.’ \nMiranda really doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. ‘I do feel it’s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.’\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s required. It’s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.’\nI’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I’ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that’s just disappointing.’\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to put a label on you and I can’t quite understand that. And there’s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too. I tend not to go along with that, though the time may come when I’m happy to have a reputation largely for doing one thing. For now, I just want to widen my horizons.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (D) remains aware of the pressures dancers face.",

On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I’m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it’s like to be rehearsing all day long,’ she tells me. \n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. ‘A dancer who’s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They’re hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.’ \nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. ‘There may be a piece of music I’m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I’m still required to find solutions. That won’t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces – it’d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I’m always working on big productions – the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn’t negotiable.’ \nMiranda really doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. ‘I do feel it’s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.’\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s required. It’s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.’\nI’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I’ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that’s just disappointing.’\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to put a label on you and I can’t quite understand that. And there’s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too.

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To answer the question, let's break down the passage and identify the key points that relate to Miranda's thoughts on the benefits of working in different places.\n\n1. Miranda values the experience of working with young students, as they are open to exploring new ideas and taking risks. This suggests that she benefits from the fresh perspectives and the learning environment that comes with working with students. This aligns with option (A) \"It allows her to make useful social connections.\"\n\n2. Miranda mentions that she has to adapt her work to different methods and styles of the theatres and schools she works with. This indicates that she benefits from the variety and the challenge of adapting to new environments, which aligns with option (C) \"It prevents her from sticking to one approach in her work.\"\n\n3. Miranda also talks about the importance of not being too set in her ways and the value of keeping establishing contacts with new people. This suggests that she benefits from the diversity of experiences and the social connections she makes, which again aligns with option (A).\n\n4. Miranda does not explicitly mention that working in different places helps her avoid being easily influenced by others, which would align with option (B).\n\n5. While Miranda does discuss the importance of the music, dance steps, and the overall production, she does not directly state that working in different places helps her understand how different attitudes to work cause problems, which would align with option (D).\n\nBased on the passage, the most fitting answer is (A) \"It allows her to make useful social connections,\" as Miranda emphasizes the value of working with students, adapting to new environments, and establishing new contacts, all of which contribute to her social connections. Option (C) is also a close contender, but it is more about her approach to work rather than the social benefits. Options (B) and (D) are not directly supported by the passage."

On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I’m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it’s like to be rehearsing all day long,’ she tells me. \n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. ‘A dancer who’s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They’re hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.’ \nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. ‘There may be a piece of music I’m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I’m still required to find solutions. That won’t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces – it’d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I’m always working on big productions – the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn’t negotiable.’ \nMiranda really doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. ‘I do feel it’s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.’\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s required. It’s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.’\nI’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I’ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that’s just disappointing.’\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to put a label on you and I can’t quite understand that. And there’s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too. I tend not to go along with that, though the time may come when I’m happy to have a reputation largely for doing one thing. For now, I just want to widen my horizons.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (C) She is pleased that it reveals the truth about being a dancer.",

Miranda discusses the challenges of working with different theatres and schools, which have varying methods and styles.\n2. She mentions the need to adapt her work to each new environment, rather than sticking to a single approach.\n3. Miranda talks about the difficulties of working with certain composers and their music, and how it can be frustrating when dancers don't respond well.\n4. She emphasizes the importance of all elements (music, costumes, lighting, and dancers) coming together in a production.\n5. Miranda mentions that perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and allows for some artistic decisions to be forgiven.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options in light of the passage:\n\n(A) Combining too many elements in one performance: The passage doesn't specifically mention that productions can combine too many elements.\n(B) Being spoilt by a problem outside her control: The passage does mention frustrations with music and dancers not responding well, but it doesn't necessarily imply that these are problems outside her control.\n(C) Failing to win people’s complete approval: The passage discusses the challenges of achieving perfection and the need to aim high, but it doesn't directly state that productions fail to win complete approval.\n(D) Lacking the resources that she expects: The passage doesn't mention any issues with resources.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (C) is the closest to the challenges mentioned in the passage.

In fact, it mentions that the musical score is non-negotiable once chosen, suggesting a focus on fitting the dance to the existing music rather than combining too many elements.\n\n2. **Option B: Be spoilt by a problem outside her control.**\n   - The passage mentions that Miranda has to adapt to different institutions and methods each time she works somewhere new. However, it does not specifically state that her productions are \"spoilt\" by problems outside her control. The closest reference is the non-negotiability of the musical score, but this is more about the structure of the production rather than being \"spoilt.\"\n\n3. **Option C: Fail to win people's complete approval.**\n   - The passage mentions that perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and allows for a few wrong artistic decisions or choices. This suggests that Miranda recognizes that her productions may not always meet everyone's expectations perfectly, indicating that they might fail to win people's complete approval.\n\n4. **Option D: Lack the resources that she expects.**\n   - The passage does not mention any specific lack of resources that Miranda expects but does not receive. It does talk about the constraints of working with pre-written music, but this is more about adapting to the situation rather than lacking expected resources.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the most accurate answer based on the passage is:\n\n**C: Fail to win people's complete approval.**\n\nThis aligns with Miranda's acknowledgment that while aiming high is appreciated, perfection is not always achievable, and her productions may not always meet everyone's expectations perfectly.",

        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "Miranda says that productions she’s worked on can sometimes lack the resources that she expects. (Option D)\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Miranda discusses the challenges she faces in her work, such as having to work with a fixed musical score and adapting to different methods and styles of various theatres and schools.\n2. She mentions that she would like to be more experimental and have the option of switching to different pieces, but she is often working on big productions with a fixed score.\n3. Miranda also talks about the importance of all elements coming together in a production, and how a few wrong artistic decisions or choices can be tolerated.\n4. She mentions that sometimes the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props completely distracts, which is disappointing.\n5. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Miranda expects all elements of a production to come together harmoniously, and when they don't, it can be seen as a lack of resources or support.

On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I’m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it’s like to be rehearsing all day long,’ she tells me. \n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. ‘A dancer who’s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They’re hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.’ \nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. ‘There may be a piece of music I’m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I’m still required to find solutions. That won’t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces – it’d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I’m always working on big productions – the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn’t negotiable.’ \nMiranda really doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. ‘I do feel it’s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.’\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s required. It’s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.’\nI’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I’ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that’s just disappointing.’\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to put a label on you and I can’t quite understand that. And there’s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too. I tend not to go along with that, though the time may come when I’m happy to have a reputation largely for doing one thing. For now, I just want to widen my horizons.’\nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B2\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) resists attempts to define her in a particular way.",

Nearly all the children know how to swim and play table-tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them.  Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end.

First we tell them they can phone home after lunch.  Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow.  Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.\nIt's not always the children who feel lonely.  We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is getting on, which is quite unnecessary.

Nearly all the children know how to swim and play table-tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them.  Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end.  This makes them feel great.\nWe do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week.  It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds.  We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time.  First we tell them they can phone home after lunch.  Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow.  Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.\nIt's not always the children who feel lonely.  We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is getting on, which is quite unnecessary.  Often their son or daughter will be busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to ring back another time.\nWe often get a certain type of child coming, typically dressed in expensive  new clothes.  Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but before long they understand the reason why. \nCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level: B1\n\nCorrect Answer: (A) I hated it at first when they made me put on old jeans, but I guess they were right.",

        "Qwen25_7B_Inst_answer": "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's analyze each option in the context of the reference passage:\n\n1. **Option A**: \"I hated it at first when they made me put on old jeans, but I guess they were right.\"\n   - This statement aligns with the last paragraph of the reference passage, which mentions children who are initially resistant to changing into more suitable clothing (\"Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable\"). However, it doesn't directly relate to the main themes of the passage about children's experiences at the camp.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"It's so unfair – everyone else can use their mobile phone, but they won't let me use mine.\"\n   - This statement reflects the issue of mobile phone usage mentioned in the passage. It also aligns with the concern of older children (ten- to thirteen-year-olds) feeling lonely and missing home. However, the focus on fairness and mobile phones isn't the central theme of the passage.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"I've made some good friends but we're all bored because there's nothing to do here.\"\n   - This statement doesn't align well with the passage, which emphasizes the children's success in activities like rock climbing and swimming. The passage suggests that while some children might feel bored initially, they generally have positive experiences.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"I was really frightened every time we went rock climbing, so they let me do something else instead.\"\n   - This statement directly relates to the passage, which discusses children feeling nervous about rock climbing but eventually succeeding. The passage mentions that children are encouraged to try and, if needed, are given alternative activities. This aligns perfectly with the theme of the passage and the children's positive experiences.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. I was really frightened every time we went rock climbing, so they let me do something else instead.**\n\nThis option best reflects the experiences and supportive environment described in the passage.",
        "Gemma2_2B_answer": "Here's how to break down the answer:\n\n1. **Understand the passage:** The passage describes a summer camp experience, focusing on how the camp helps children overcome challenges and have a good time. It also mentions some of the challenges the camp faces, like children missing home and parents being overly involved.\n\n2. **Identify the purpose of the postcard:**  A postcard is a way for someone to send a message home from a place they are visiting.  \n\n3. **Analyze the options:**  We need to look for a postcard that reflects a child's experience at camp. \n\n    * **(A) I hated it at first when they made me put on old jeans, but I guess they were right.**  This sounds like a complaint about a rule, not something a child would likely write to their family.\n    * **(B) It's so unfair – everyone else can use their mobile phone, but they won't let me use mine.** This is a complaint about a rule, and it's likely a child would be upset about it.\n    * **(C) I've made some good friends but we're all bored because there's nothing to do here.** This is a statement about the camp's activities, which could be a good thing to share with family.\n    * **(D) I was really frightened every time we went rock climbing, so they let me do something else instead.** This is a personal experience, and it could be a good way to show the camp's understanding of individual needs.\n\n4. **Choose the best option:**  Option (C) is the most likely to be written by a child at camp. It expresses a common feeling of boredom and a desire for more activities. \n\n\n**Therefore, the answer is (C).** \n",
        "Qwen25_3B_Inst_answer": "To answer this reading comprehension question, let's analyze each option in the context of the passage and consider what a child might realistically write about their experience at the camp.\n\n**Option A:** \"I hated it at first when they made me put on old jeans, but I guess they were right.\"\n- The passage doesn't mention anything about having to wear old jeans or any clothing restrictions. Therefore, this option does not align with the context provided.\n\n**Option B:** \"It's so unfair – everyone else can use their mobile phone, but they won't let me use mine.\"\n- The passage states that children are not allowed to use mobile phones all the time, but it doesn't specify that they are allowed to use them at all times. Thus, this option seems plausible given the restrictions mentioned.\n\n**Option C:** \"I've made some good friends but we're all bored because there's nothing to do here.\"\n- While the passage mentions that some children feel bored due to limited activities, it does not explicitly state that they are all bored. Additionally, it highlights that the children succeeded at new experiences like rock climbing, suggesting they may find other engaging activities. Therefore, this option might be plausible but is less likely than Option B.\n\n**Option D:** \"I was really frightened every time we went rock climbing, so they let me do something else instead.\"\n- The passage mentions that children who are nervous about rock climbing are encouraged to try and eventually succeed. However, it does not specifically describe a child being frightened and then having to do something else. This option is less aligned with the passage.\n\nGiven the context and the details provided in the passage, **Option B** seems to best reflect a realistic situation a child might face at the camp and express through a postcard home. \n\n**Final Answer:** (B)",
        "Phi4MiniInst_answer": "To determine which postcard a child at the camp might send home, let's analyze each option in the context of the reference passage:\n\n(A) \"I hated it at first when they made me put on old jeans, but I guess they were right.\"\n- The passage mentions that children in expensive new clothes often argue when told to change into something more suitable. This option aligns with the camp's approach to dressing children in more appropriate attire.\n\n(B) \"It's so unfair – everyone else can use their mobile phone, but they won't let me use mine.\"\n- The passage states that children are initially told they can phone home after lunch, and later, they are told it's too late to phone now. This option reflects the camp's policy on mobile phone usage.\n\n(C) \"I've made some good friends but we're all bored because there's nothing to do here.\"\n- The passage describes the camp as a place where children succeed in new activities like rock climbing, and it mentions that children come to thank the camp at the end of their stay. This option does not align with the positive experiences described in the passage.\n\n(D) \"I was really frightened every time we went rock climbing, so they let me do something else instead.\"\n- The passage mentions that children who feel nervous about rock climbing eventually try it and succeed, feeling great afterward. This option contradicts the camp's positive experience with rock climbing.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely postcard a child at the camp might send home is:\n\n(B) \"It's so unfair – everyone else can use their mobile phone, but they won't let me use mine.\""
