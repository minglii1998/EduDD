    "title": "Animal emotions\nTom Whipple asks ‘Do animals really have emotions? And what are the consequences if they do?’",
    "text": "In a Swedish zoo a chimpanzee called Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions would have been largely seen as irrelevant. Animals had behaviours, the behaviours produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. The idea that animals have consciousness, feelings and moral systems was sloppy and sentimental.\nBut recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, not to mention rats, dolphins and chickens, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. It is a change that has in recent years filtered through the scientific strata to a selection of popular science books, such as Mark Bekoff’s Wild Justice and Victoria Braithwaite’s Do Fish Feel Pain?. And in the process it has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness?\nThis debate stimulates a second, much less abstract, one: not of consciousness, but conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. In a recent experiment involving cows that had to open a locked gate in order to get food, it became apparent that those that successfully opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure – by jumping and kicking their legs – than those that had to have the gate opened for them. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef?  \nThe observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. According to Dr Jonathan Balcombe, author of Second Nature, the only logically consistent response to the new research is to stop eating meat. For him, humanity is on the verge of the greatest revolution in ethics since the abolition of slavery. According to Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. For him, ‘the only tenable hypothesis is that animals do have a theory of mind, but it’s simpler than ours.’ And according to Professor Euan MacPhail we should just stop anthropomorphising. The three may never be reconciled because the crux of the issue is not so much a scientific disagreement, or even a moral one, but a philosophical one. Given that even defining consciousness is near impossible, can we ever hope to know, in the words of the philosopher Thomas Nagel, what it is like to be a bat? Let alone a bat midwife.\nBalcombe describes a landmark experiment he did that – in his interpretation – appears to show that starlings – a type of bird – can get depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were housed in luxurious cages, with plenty of space and water. The other half were housed in small, barren cages. Initially both groups were fed with tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and soon learned to take only from the tasty box. But subsequently when the birds were offered only unpleasant worms, only the ones housed in luxurious cages would eat.  It seemed, or at least Balcombe concluded, that being in a nasty cage caused the starlings to be pessimistic about life in general.  \nBalcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. ‘We look back with abhorrence on an era where there was racism,’ he says. ‘Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t espouse animal rights between bites of a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only advocate of this view of animal consciousness, it might be easy to dismiss him as an extremist. Unfortunately for those who might prefer to ignore Balcome, Professor Aubrey Manning is in the same camp. Manning has written a textbook, An Introduction to Animal Behaviour. ‘What we are seeing is a pendulum swing,’ he says. ‘At the turn of the 20th century there were people who made assumptions that animals thought just like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a highly contentious subject and you really want to try to avoid the sound of academics with various personal grievances and strong personal opinions.’",

    "title": "Home Advantage in Sport",
    "text": "Everyone knows that sports teams enjoy a big advantage whenever they play at home.  But does anyone know why?  Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious.  But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.  Two driving forces have served to question whether traditional wisdom can be relied on when it comes to explaining home advantage: science and money.  Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform to their full potential and in so doing they have raised myriad theories on the impact of home advantage.  Meanwhile, the moneymen want to know why home advantage should still matter at all.  If they are paid enough surely the players should feel comfortable anywhere?\nSo where does all this leave the fans?  Would it matter say, if Manchester United were to play some of their home games in the Far East so as to catch their fan base there?  It would to the British home fans, who believe that their team need their passion and their loyal commitment to the cause, which may be why they confuse cause and effect.  It is human nature to imagine that a sequence of events is best explained by the order in which we remember them rather than the order in which they happened.  When a team go forward, the home support gets to its feet and starts to generate more noise; every now and then, one of these forward moves results in a goal, and the crowd sound explodes.  What fans tend to remember is that when they began to holler, scream and shout, a goal was scored.  What they omit are the countless times when the noise fizzled out because the move did not succeed.\nHowever, there is one conventional fan’s-eye view that does seem to be confirmed by the scientific evidence.  As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.  In a now famous experiment, a sample of referees was exposed to a recording of a match, with half watching with all the crowd effects and half watching a silent version.  The researchers found that the referees who heard the version with sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team than the ones who saw the game in silence (though, interestingly, the baying of the home crowd did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team).  This coincided with the actual decisions of the match official on the day.  The researchers concluded that referees shield themselves from extra stress that would be caused by making calls against the home team.  It’s not that the officials do what the crowd wants; they just try not to do whatever would direct the crowd’s fury straight at them.\nRecent studies of home advantage have analysed long-term historical trends.  They reveal that home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.  For instance, during the earliest years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70 per cent of the points on offer, compared to 60 per cent today.  One reason for this may well be travel, which used to be a laborious business; these days, football virtuosos are ferried around in unimaginable luxury and, if the hotel room isn’t good enough, someone from the club is at hand to find them another.  Local conditions were more likely to vary wildly but now the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency.  And yet, plausible as all these explanations are, none of them really fits the data.  These changes – cosseted stars, modern-day man servants, identikit stadiums (and also bringing in professional arbitrators) – all happened relatively recently, in the past decade or two.\nThe enduring mystery is why home advantage should vary depending on the sport.  Basketball is the game where playing at home is most advantageous, closely followed by football.  But baseball remains the sport where home advantage counts for least.  One possible explanation may be that home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in baseball there may be less team spirit since it is more about individual confrontations between batter and pitcher.  Team sports are about co-ordinating with your team mates.  In a sport such as basketball, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court.  It is this confidence that seems to be boosted by the familiarity of playing at home, regardless of any differences in the playing conditions.\nThere is a further possibility, one that connects to the darker side of sport.  Researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were average before training sessions and away matches, but were up to 67 per cent higher before home matches.  This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers such as in the recent Rugby World Cup.  There were two classic games in which the underdogs, playing at home, triumphed against better-fancied opposition, using grit, channelled aggression and a seemingly unquenchable refusal to be intimidated – this had all the hallmarks of home advantage. As one referee aptly summed it up, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’",

    "title": "Sleep, wonderful sleep!\nTravel reporter Daisann McLane enjoys a good sleep when she is away from home",
    "text": "Sleeping is one of my deepest travel pleasures, but I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their intricately planned trips, in which every second of precious travel time is pencilled in with activities, like museums and mountain treks, I smile encouragingly and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include yawningly empty slots for late afternoon naps under sudden Caribbean downpours and lazy mornings nestled between beautiful Italian sheets?\nBetter sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was shocked by how many hours – more than 12 – I spent sleeping most days. There were lots of noisy birds in the neighboring lot, but it didn't matter. Far from home and from my own bed, surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound, dream-filled, and enjoyable than I imagined possible.\nLiberated from alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep flows more easily. But I don't think simple de-stressing explains why the quality and texture of travel sleep is so dramatically different. My theory is that sleep is actually an extension of our travels, not a pause or respite from them. When traveling, we open ourselves to novel sights, sounds, smells, and ways of being. New and unfamiliar stuff pours into us – cultures, music, landscapes, even ways of moving through space. It is when sleeping that we wade through this overwhelming river of stimuli. No wonder, then, that sleep becomes so much more intense when we are on the road.\nSleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. \t\tOn the Caribbean island of Trinidad, for example, people awaken at the crack of dawn to get going before the heat sets in, fall into torpor around 10 a.m., when the sun is high, then return to life with the cool evening breezes. Though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, my home base, I still take days to acclimatise to the island's different patterns of sleep and wakefulness.\nWhen, at last, I do fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, when I shared a huge midday meal with a group of new Dominican friends in a big apartment overlooking the blue Caribbean Sea. Weighed down by food and heat, the conversation slowly faded, and finally stopped. One by one my friends abandoned the table to flop on nearby hammocks and sofas. I suddenly understood why my hosts had so many pillows and bolsters on the floor. I grabbed a couple for myself and followed my friends' example. I'd always known about the venerable Latin American custom of the siesta, but that day I experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a slice of Dominican life.\nTravel sleep has another wonderful attribute: it is sleep I remember. Separated by distance and culture from my normal sleep routine, I soon find that I luxuriate in the unexpected fragrances, textures, and sounds that fill my sleeping brain in a new place. If a commitment to ‘slow travel’ – enjoying every experience to the full rather than rushing about trying to do everything – is what now distinguishes the aware modern traveler, well, what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my behavior and come clean to my ambitious friends, explaining to them that travel sleep is, after all, an activity too.",

    "title": "Interview with a young choreographer\nMartin Fields talks to Miranda Ellington about her life and work.",
    "text": "At 25, Miranda Ellington has already achieved a great deal as a choreographer, creating works for a long list of theatres and dance companies. On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I’m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it’s like to be rehearsing all day long,’ she tells me. \n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. ‘A dancer who’s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They’re hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.’ \nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. ‘There may be a piece of music I’m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I’m still required to find solutions. That won’t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces – it’d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I’m always working on big productions – the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn’t negotiable.’ \nMiranda really doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. ‘I do feel it’s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.’\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s required. It’s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.’\nI’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I’ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that’s just disappointing.’\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to put a label on you and I can’t quite understand that. And there’s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too. I tend not to go along with that, though the time may come when I’m happy to have a reputation largely for doing one thing. For now, I just want to widen my horizons.’",

    "title": "Keeping pace with scientific publishing\nScience correspondent Joe Cushing considers old and new ways of publishing scientific research",
    "text": "Journal-based peer review – the process of subjecting a scientific research paper to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field – is generally held up as the quality assurance mechanism for research. It professes to be an essential filter which prevents publishing flawed or nonsensical papers, and indeed is often touted as such in reassuring tones when scientists talk to the media or the general public. Reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year; is that a price worth paying to ensure the trustworthiness of the published literature? Well, yes and no. And picking apart such issues reveals a great deal about the state of scientific publishing, which is very much in flux.\nI’m not yet ready to abandon journal-based peer review. I’d still like to see all papers pass some sort of checking stage before formal publication, but I feel the ground moving. The growing use of preprints (drafts of papers which are posted online without having been peer reviewed, found in digital archives) is a crucial part of that shift because they bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results so they can be read, critiqued and built upon. Publication in journals has become more about renown and career advancement, and this has perverted both the motivations of authors and the job of reviewers. \nCompetition for prized spots in highly-regarded journals drives scientists to do some of their best work and the best journals certainly publish plenty of outstanding research. But the excessive rewards for publishing in top journals are incentives to corner-cutting, as stories streamlined by the omission of inconvenient data are more likely to be taken up. And the job of the reviewer also becomes distorted: it is more often now to decide, not whether a manuscript is any good, but whether it is good enough for the journal considering publication. For top journals that can depend as much on topicality or newsworthiness as scientific quality.\nThese problems are well known, but the tragedy for science is that too few people are willing to break away from the present system. However, as the eminent biologist Ron Vale argued recently – fittingly, in a preprint – preprints may be a way out of the impasse because they don’t entail a major shift away from the norm. That may seem an odd claim in view of the fact that preprint archives have been in existence for twenty years, yet preprints have not been adopted universally. This slow uptake is not only a reflection of the inherent conservatism of scientists, but also a result of the widespread misconception that journals won’t accept manuscripts which have been posted online as preprints. There is also a fear that publication of papers without peer review risks opening the floodgates to ‘junk science’ – something which, so far at least, has yet to occur. Preprints may not be peer reviewed, but authors know full well that preprints are immediately opened up for critique and discussion by a worldwide community of reviewers.\nTanya Elks, a psychology professor, recalls: ‘My paper was a critique of a published paper – a scenario which isn’t well handled by the conventional journals. Under their system of anonymous peer reviewing, either the authors of the original paper are chosen as reviewers and there is a risk that the unscrupulous ones might block a critical paper; or they’re not chosen and may justifiably complain about misrepresentation. As we posted a preprint, the original authors had their say and we could take their points on board. All the commentary is out in the open so readers can evaluate the quality of the arguments. The possibility of rejection by journals is less of an issue too, given that we’ll still have the preprint and comments out in the public domain, so our work won’t be wasted.’\nPreprint archives enable, on a global scale, the informal scientific discussions once confined to correspondence between individuals. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results – a vital aspect of the scientific process often overlooked by the journals’ excessive preoccupation with new discoveries. Furthermore, presence on preprint archives significantly increases the number of times papers are read and cited by others; a potent demonstration of the efficacy of dissemination through preprint. By harnessing the web’s culture of openness and accessibility and recalling the collaborative, amateur ethos still at large within the scientific community, preprints should help to refocus attention where it matters - on the work itself, not where it is published.",

    "title": "An unusual race",
    "text": "To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, champion triathletes, to take part in a unique race that would set man against car, and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car – and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ The head went back, the arms up. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car pulled up and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said with disappointment. ‘I’m gutted.’",

    "title": "What is a poem?",
    "text": "When I ask my literature students what a poem is, I generally get answers like ‘a painting in words’. Their answers rarely satisfy me, or them. Then one day I asked a group to choose an object, and to write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself, to be entitled ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote:\nPoem\nI may look weird or terrifying, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used for emergencies and even then only for a limited time. Most people will never have to use me.\nThe item? An oxygen mask – a rather incongruous choice which enabled the class to appreciate how poetry operates as nothing else in the world does. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.\nWhen I was at school, infuriatingly, poetry seemed to make little sense to me. I saw every poem as a ludicrous puzzle which got in the way of true understanding and feeling. Once school is over, poetry is, for most people, something which grabs them less and less. Occasionally you see one, and a poem announces itself by what it is not: continuous prose. It practically dares you to read it, which you do, and too often feel disappointed by its blandness, or because it baffles initial comprehension. Nevertheless, you pat yourself on the back for trying.\nWhat do we hope to find in the poems we read? Isn’t a poem a home for deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit? The answer may appear to be yes. But if tears are required, we look to films; for information or incisive critique, we might read an online article. But novels offer us worlds to escape to, painting offers us eye candy, and music – well, what can compete with that sublime combination of lyrics, instruments, and melody? There is, however, one kind of utility that a poem can embody: ambiguity. And day-to-day living – unlike sentence-to-sentence reading – is filled with it.\nBut such observations still don’t tell us what a poem really is. Search an online encyclopaedia for ‘poem’, and it redirects to ‘poetry': ‘a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language such as sound symbolism, etc.’ Fine English-professor speak, but it belies the word’s linguistic roots. ‘Poem’ is from the Greek poí?ma, which translates as a ‘thing made,’ and a poet is defined as ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it?\nPoets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable, unpredictable – or to machines – human-engineered and precise – depending on personal viewpoint. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. Whether or not you view a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can still change your conception of what a machine or wild animal is. It can help the mind experiment with its well-trodden patterns of thought, and can reroute these patterns by making us see commonplace things in a new light. \nThe poem as mental object is no difficult reach, especially if we consider the extent to which song lyrics can get stuck in our heads. The intermingling of words and melody has a potency going back to schoolyard rhymes like ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Consider a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, staring you in the face: A poem has the power to hit home like nothing else can, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it.\nWhat about all that costly white space around the poem – space which could have been given over to a longer article or advertisement? A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity. Publishing houses dutifully write press releases and send out review copies of poetry collections, but few expect a collection to cover its printing costs. A poem presents itself not as a thing for the marketplace, but as a thing for its own sake. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem still has the ability to surprise, if only for a moment.",

    "title": "Give childhood back to children\nPsychologist Mark Dobson gives his opinions on the value of play",
    "text": "I’m a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I’ve done lots of school.  I’m a pretty good problem-solver, in my work and in the rest of my life, but that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had.  Most problems in life cannot be solved with some complex formula or memorised answers of the type learnt in school.  They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.  For children, those experiences are embedded in play.\nThe main focus of my own recent research is on the value of play for children’s development.  All mammals, including humans obviously, play when they are young and those that have the most to learn play the most.  Carnivores play more than herbivores, because hunting is harder to learn than grazing.  Primates play more than other mammals, because their way of life depends more on learning and less on fixed instincts than does that of other mammals.  Children, who have the most to learn, play far more than any other young primates when they are allowed to do so.  Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves.\nThe most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school.  Such skills cannot be taught at all.  They are learnt and practised by children in play.  These include the abilities to think creatively, to get along with other people and co-operate effectively, and to control their own impulses and emotions.  Creativity is key to economic success.  We no longer need people to obey instructions in robot-like ways, or to perform calculations that are now routine, or to answer questions which have already been answered.  But we do need people who can ask and seek answers to new questions and solve new problems.  If we can breed thinkers to anticipate obstacles before they arise, we will create a workforce to be reckoned with.  But this requires the ability to think creatively. The creative mind is a playful mind.\nAdults whom we call geniuses are those who somehow retain and build upon that childlike capacity throughout their lives.  Albert Einstein said his schooling almost destroyed his interest in mathematics and physics, but he recovered it when he left school.  He referred to his innovative work as ‘combinatorial play’.  He claimed that he developed his concept of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam and catching up with it, and then thinking about the consequences.  We can’t teach creativity, but we can drive it out of people through schooling that centres not on children’s own questions but on questions dictated by an imposed curriculum that operates as if all questions have one right answer and everyone must learn the same things.\nEven more important than creativity is the capacity to get along with other people, to care about them and to co-operate effectively with them.  Children everywhere are born with a strong drive to play with other children and such play is the means by which they acquire social skills and practise fairness and morality, which they will need in order to participate fully later in life.  Play, by definition, is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit.  If you can’t quit, it’s not play.  All players know that, and so they know that to keep the game going, they must keep the other players happy.  The power to quit is what makes play the most democratic of all activities.\nSchool has become more onerous: breaks have been reduced, homework piled up, and pressure for high grades increased.  Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. ‘Play dates’, with adults present, have replaced unsupervised neighbourhood play, and adults now feel it is their duty to intervene rather than let children solve their own problems.  These changes have been gradual, imperceptible, but over time they have been enormous.  They have been caused by a constellation of social factors, including parents’ fears, the rise of experts warning us about dangers, the decline of cohesive neighbourhoods and the view that children learn more from teachers and other adult directors than they do from one another.  Our children don’t need more school.  They need more play.  If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century.  We must give childhood back to children.  Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future.",

    "text": "The woman turned around from the mirror. ‘What do you think? And be honest.’ Mia picked up a medium-sized brimmed hat that was softened with a pretty layer of gauze and trimmed with a silk bow, ‘I still think this one suited you best,’ she said to her customer with well-practised diplomacy.\nWrinkling her nose, the woman scrunched up her face, giving herself the unfortunate appearance of a bulldog. ‘But it is so boring,’ she said. ‘Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. Whereas this little beauty will make me stand out from the crowd. Sighing, she patted the red and black miniature top hat that was perched at a jaunty angle on her head. ‘Yes,’ she said decisively, ‘this is the one I want.’\nMia knew when she was beaten and with a smile firmly in place and agreeing that the woman would indeed stand out from the crowd at her daughter’s wedding, she thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together.\nIt was a while since she’d managed to get everyone in the same place and she was looking forward to seeing Jen and Dan and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her. A friend they knew nothing about, as her husband Jeff had been only too quick to point out when Jen had phoned last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ‘Tattie,’ Jeff had said in response to Mia relaying the news, ‘What sort of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana’, Mia had replied. ‘I think it’s nice.’ ‘More like something very affected,’ Jeff retorted.\nHer husband had no time for affectation or anything of an ostentatious nature. Nor did he believe in ‘pussyfooting about’, as he called Mia’s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have held back with this woman in the shop: he would have come right out with the truth and informed her that she was choosing the wrong hat. Moreover, he probably would have said that a dustbin lid would flatter her more. ‘The trouble with you, Mia,’ he regularly said, ‘is that you’re much too polite for your own good.’ \nAn hour later Mia had shut up shop and was letting herself in at the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work took all of forty seconds. Four years ago when Luke, the youngest of their children, had left home, Mia had had the idea of converting the unused barn to the side of the house into a light and airy space from which she could run her own business, Jeff had been sceptical. ‘You really think the demand for hats is out there?’ he’d asked. Mia knew, from listening to friends bemoaning the difficulty of tracking down the perfect hat to complete an outfit for a special occasion, that the demand was most definitely there.\nShe was proved right. From day one, after Jen had helped her to create a website to promote the business, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from miles around to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham where, in a relaxed and welcoming environment, she gave them the opportunity to try on as many hats as it took to find what they were looking for. With changing rooms on offer, she encouraged her customers to bring their outfits with them so that nothing was left to chance. She had recently extended the service and started selling handbags and costume jewellery as well.",

    "title": "OUR FAMILY GREAT AMERICAN ROAD TRIP\nBy Jack Morgan",
    "text": "When most people think of a leisurely family vacation, I guess a cross-country adventure through nine western states in the US plus a Canadian province doesn’t automatically spring to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the modern teenager’s worst nightmare: the ultimate family bonding trip. \n‘Not enough people do this anymore’ was the line he and my mother spouted in the weeks leading up to our vacation as my twin brother and I shot each other horrified glances that screamed, ‘Well, there are probably good reasons why!’\nMid-June arrived. We crammed our car full of suitcases, coolers, and a wild assortment of clothing to combat whatever Mother Nature threw at us. Though I was thrilled, I was sure going to miss my privacy for the next two weeks, although I already had a few coping strategies up my sleeve. With barely enough room left for us inside the car, we set off on ‘The Family Great American Road Trip’. As we left behind our spacious home in favor of more “cozy” accommodations for the next five thousand miles, I wasn’t the only one in the car wondering what we were getting ourselves into…\nWe shot straight west, out through the Oklahoma panhandle. Though still close to home, we were not without our fair share of adventures. My family finally stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest star-filled skies in the nation, but only after nearly being blown off the highway in a dust storm. We quickly learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way! The next day, we were up at dawn and moving again. I sensed a pattern forming.\nDesert gave way to mountains. The days began to blend together, but each adventure was still distinct. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes, and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The heavy smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a taste of what we were going to experience later in our journey. Clinging to the mountainside at one point as we climbed to our next destination, we learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. The fusion of ancient and modern could be seen everywhere we stopped. Dodging construction traffic just became routine. Disappointment turned to laughter as we posed by the enormous “CLOSED” signs in front of the Four Corners Monument.\nWe passed countless wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park where we watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. ‘Bear jams’, policed by park volunteers, were simply expected while driving through, when traffic would back up to let one cross. And our own close encounter with one on the road (and an anxious park ranger) left us with some unforgettable memories. As we drove on, life back home faded away, and even the hotel we stayed in, with all its inconveniences, couldn’t dent our enthusiasm - a creaky, rustic 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone services. However, in exchange for these, I got to experience the most wonderful views I’ve ever seen.\nAfter watching a rainstorm blow through from a cozy perch in our hotel in Canada, my family and I made our free-fall back south again. My parents had been right. You don’t have to escape to some exotic foreign land to discover something remarkable. It was bittersweet to be home together again, but at least I hadn’t fought with my brother in our one \nhundred hours on the road! Three thousand photos chronicling our crazy journey waited to be sifted through and rediscovered. And I knew that for me, the things I’d remember would be the unplanned, the spontaneous.",

    "title": "New School",
    "text": "Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She glances around nervously, looking for journalists that aren’t there. Let’s see how long it takes before the madness begins. Because it will, you know. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-one-of-your-dad’s-concerts?\n‘Everything’s going to be fine,’ I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school, whole new situation to deal with. But this is what I asked her for. To get away from my old life on the road and tour tutors. So while the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we’re staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet real kids for a change. How about a kid with a mother who types from nine to five in an office? Or a dad who cuts grass? That’d be so cool. So normal.\nI walk in the school’s main office. \n‘Hi, I need my schedule please,’ I tell the school secretary. \n‘Name?’ She looks about as friendly as an ice bucket. \n‘Desert McGraw.’ \n‘Desirée?’ she makes a face, leaning her ear closer to me. \n‘Desert,’ I repeat. \nThe secretary seems confused. ‘Oh,’ she says and types ‘McGraw’ on her keyboard.\nThat’s one good thing. Few people ever recognize my last name because my dad only goes by his stage name. \n‘What grade?’ \n‘Eleventh.’ \n‘One second, it’s printing,’ the secretary says.\nThen she rips the sheet at the perforation and hands it to me. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. \n‘Aurelio Gonzalez.’ \n‘Here.’\nShe goes on while I slip in undetected and slide into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes scan over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now! \n‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. \nI look down at my expensive platforms with the tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. Dead giveaway. \n‘Thanks,’ I say. \nThe teacher pauses in the roll taking. \n‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. \n‘Here.’\nThe teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize! All teachers should realize the importance of this. \n‘So why’d you move here?’ my new friend asks. Let’s see, I have lots of choices here. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras, reporters, and the red carpet? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ‘We need a change, Desert,’ he said, ‘and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just the essence our last album desperately needed.’ Essence? Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they have picked South Beach Sounds, a recording studio two steps from the sand? \n‘My dad had to relocate,’ I tell her. Yes, lies always work better. \n‘What does he do?’ she pries. \nOh, whatever. Everyone’s going to find out eventually, anyway. But at least I’ll have some time to fake normality until they do.\n‘He’s an artist,’ I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. \n‘Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.’\nAnd she couldn’t have cared less. Excellent.",

    "title": "City Life\nThe advantages and disadvantages of urban living",
    "text": "Cities have always been an engine of intellectual life, from the 18th-century coffee houses of London, where citizens gathered to discuss chemistry and radical politics, to the Left Bank cafés of modern Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso held forth on modern art. And yet, city life isn't easy. The same London cafés that stimulated discussion also helped spread cholera; Picasso eventually decamped to the country. The modern city might be a haven of creativity, but it's also a deeply unnatural and overwhelming place. Now scientists have begun to examine how the city affects the brain, and the results are chastening. While it's long been recognized that city life is exhausting, this new research suggests that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so.\nOne of the main forces at work is a stark lack of something surprisingly beneficial for the brain: nature. Studies have demonstrated, for instance, that hospital patients recover more quickly when they can see trees from their windows. Even these fleeting glimpses of nature improve brain performance, it seems, because they provide a mental break from the urban grind. This research arrives just as humans pass an important milestone: For the first time in history, the majority reside in cities. Instead of inhabiting wide-open spaces, we're crowded into concrete jungles, surrounded by millions of strangers. In recent years, it's become clear that such unnatural surroundings have important implications for our mental and physical health, and can powerfully alter how we think.\nConsider everything your brain has to keep track of as you walk down a busy thoroughfare: distracted pedestrians; hazardous crossings requiring the brain to monitor the flow of traffic (the brain is a wary machine, always alert for potential threats); and the confusing urban grid. The reason such seemingly trivial mental tasks leave us depleted is that they exploit one of the crucial weak spots of the brain. A city is so overstuffed with stimuli that we need to continually redirect our attention. This sort of controlled perception – telling the brain what to ignore and what not to – takes energy and effort. The mind is like a powerful supercomputer, but the act of paying attention consumes much of its processing power.\nNatural settings, in contrast, don't require the same amount of cognitive effort. This idea is known as attention restoration theory, and was first developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. While it's long been known that human attention is a scarce resource – focusing in the morning makes it harder to focus in the afternoon – Kaplan hypothesized that immersion in nature might have a restorative effect. Natural settings are full of objects that automatically capture our attention, yet they do not trigger any negative emotional responses – unlike, say, a police siren. The mental machinery that directs attention can relax deeply, replenishing itself.\nIn fact, long before scientists became concerned, philosophers and landscape architects were warning about the effects of the undiluted city, and looking for ways to integrate nature into modern life. Vibrant urban parks, such as Central Park in New York, allow the masses an escape from urban life. A properly designed park can improve the function of the brain within minutes. While people have searched high and low for ways to improve cognitive performance, from energy drinks to redesigning the layout of offices, it appears that few of these treatments are as effective as simply taking a walk in a natural place.\nSo, given the myriad mental problems that are exacerbated by city life, the question remains: Why do cities continue to grow? And why, even in the electronic age, do they endure as wellsprings of intellectual life?\nRecent research at the Santa Fe Institute demonstrated that the very same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory – the crowded streets, the sheer crushing closeness of people – also correlate with measures of innovation. It is the ‘concentration of social interactions’ that is largely responsible for urban creativity, according to scientists. Just as the crowded nature of 18th-century London led to intellectual breakthroughs, the crowded nature of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, contributes to its success as a creative center of technology. Equally, less crowded urban areas may, over time, generate less innovation. The key, then, is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits. Because there always comes a time, as the song goes, when a person will say: ‘I'm sick of the trees take me to the city!’",

    "title": "Using social networking sites to find a job\nHaving secured her own first job recently, Patty Meissner looks at young people’s use of social networking when looking for work.",
    "text": "In many countries, a growing number of people in their twenties are turning to social media in the hope of finding work.  Services like the social networking and micro blogging site Twitter and the professional networking site LinkedIn offer the chance for direct contact with would-be employers, grabbing their attention in a way previously only achieved by those willing to stand outside the office of their choice wearing a large ‘hire me’ sign around their neck.  But with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes.\nTake the case of a young jobseeker in the US who contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn.  The marketing executive in question had an impressive list of influential people in her contact list; people whom the young jobseeker felt could help him land a job.  The marketing executive, however, had other ideas.  Indignant at the suggestion that she would willingly share a list of contacts painstakingly built up over many years with a complete stranger who’d done nothing to deserve such an opportunity, she not only rejected his contact request, but sent a vicious and heavily sarcastic rejection note that has since gone viral.  Those who saw the note online were appalled, and the sender probably now regrets the tone of her note, if not the message it conveyed. But if the incident makes young people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity, she may have actually ended up doing them a favour.  She has drawn attention to an unfortunate truth.  Social media is a potentially dangerous tool for jobhunters who don’t know how to use it.  And a worrying number are getting it wrong.\nThere’s a horrible irony here, because in many countries social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been the bread and butter of twentysomethings’ social lives for years.  When my generation were teenagers, social media was our escape from the prying eyes of parents and teachers.  It was a cyber extension of the playground pecking order – a place to impress, to embellish and experiment.  It was a world based largely on fantasy.  You could find yourself in a three-hour conversation with someone online and then completely ignore them at school.  With careful picture/song selection for your Facebook page, you could become a completely different and much more intriguing person overnight.  And if you couldn’t be bothered with conversation, ‘poking’ people on Facebook was a legitimate alternative.\nHowever, when it comes to using social media for professional networking, our very knowledge and experience of sites like Facebook may actually be a hindrance.  Using social media in a professional capacity is a completely different ball game, but for some twentysomethings, the division is not clear cut.  We first earned our online presence by being bold and over-confident, which could explain why some of us still think this is a good idea.  Just because a lot of people ‘liked’ your posts on Facebook, it doesn’t mean you’ll be able to use LinkedIn to show potential employers that you’re someone worth employing.  We need to realise that what we learned about social networking as teenagers no longer applies, and we must live up to employers’ standards if we want to get on in the world of work.\nOne of the most common complaints from employers regarding young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they’re over-familiar in their form of address, and come across as arrogant.  This serves to perpetuate older generations’ perceptions of us as an ‘entitled generation’.  In fact, we’re very far from this; in many countries we’re increasingly desperate about finding employment, which is why many of us are turning to social media in the first place.  This impression of arrogance hurts the employment prospects of young people who – despite their communication errors – actually possess the skills and drive to become a valuable part of the workforce.\nSo what’s the right way to contact someone on a professional networking site?  Firstly, explain clearly who you are, and let the person you’re writing to know what’s in it for them – maybe you could offer to do a piece of research for them, or assist in some other way.  This approach gives you a much better chance of getting a useful reply.  Refrain from sending impersonal, blanket emails, and keep the tone humble if you want to avoid leaving a sour taste in the recipient’s mouth.  Remember – social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it needs careful handling if you don’t want the door slammed in your face. ",

    "title": "Jane Goodall: chimpanzee expert",
    "text": "A very young, idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa in early April 1957 and soon, quite possibly in her first letter home, wrote the astonishingly dramatic words ‘I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood.’ She was to spend most of the rest of her life in Africa and – as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist and environmentalist – came to be associated with that continent. Her name was Jane Goodall.\nIn 1963, Britain’s National Geographical Society promoted Jane Goodall’s fame by producing a series of glossy articles and television documentaries on her chimpanzee research. That early fame has since been reinforced by her own writing for a popular audience, including award-winning children’s books and the 1971 bestseller In the Shadow of Man, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still in print. With the possible exception of Marie Curie, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist, Jane Goodall must be the most widely celebrated female scientist of the 20th century.\nIronically, her celebrity may have obscured her actual achievements. Hundreds of articles, interviews and books have told her life story but they are often limited in scope and sentimental. She has been presented as an adventure-seeking little girl, a privileged woman who dreamed of a life with wild animals, a determined feminist in a man’s world, and so on. Altogether, these images devalue what she has actually done. Based on the number of references to her research by academics in her field, the number of her students who have subsequently reached influential positions in the biological sciences, and the volume of data amassed in her forty-year-long study, Jane Goodall ought to be considered a uniquely distinguished pioneer in her field and the world’s leading zoologist. Yet her achievement can be stated more simply and directly: she opened the door to our understanding of the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.\nWild chimpanzees are dangerous, though before Goodall began her work the dangers were misunderstood and exaggerated. Prior to Goodall’s early discoveries, no one knew that chimpanzees ate meat. We had no idea that they, or indeed any large mammals other than ourselves, created and used tools. We did not realize that chimpanzees share with humans a similar set of emotions or that their social systems are startlingly like ours. We would not have believed that chimpanzee communities across Africa possess various distinctive cultural traditions.\nGoodall’s scholarly book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), ranks as the single most authoritative work in this area, the first encyclopaedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study of wild apes along the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Gombe State, Nigeria, has turned out to be, in the words of biologist Stephen Jay Gould, ‘one of the Western world’s great scientific achievements.’ Jane Goodall helped create a revolution in the way we study animals, and because the animals she studied are humankind’s closest relatives, she also helped alter the way humans think about themselves.\nEven as a child, there were a few early indicators of the person Jane Goodall would become. By far the clearest of these from her early childhood was in the autumn of 1939, when she was just five years old. One autumn day, a ‘golden afternoon’ as her mother remembers it, Jane disappeared. The police were called and began the search. Neighbours and family members joined in. After an increasingly frantic search, as dusk moved to dark, the child suddenly reappeared, alone, with fragments of straw in her hair and clothes. ‘Wherever have you been?’ her mother asked. Jane explained that she had wondered how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had crawled inside a henhouse, concealed herself in the straw, and lain perfectly still for five hours until the hen raised herself up, wiggled and provided an answer. It is tempting to consider this as the beginning of her career as a biologist.",

Many of us recognise robotic automation as an inevitably disruptive force. However, in a classic example of optimism bias, while approximately two-thirds of people believe that robots will inevitably perform most of the work currently done by humans during the next 50 years, about 80% also believe their current jobs will either ‘definitely‘ or ‘probably‘ exist in their current form within the same timeframe. Somehow, we believe our livelihoods will be safe. They’re not: every commercial sector will be affected by robotic automation in the next several years.\nFor example, Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has developed a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 standard bricks in one hour – a task that would take two human bricklayers the better part of a day or longer to complete. Two years ago, San Francisco-based startup Simbe Robotics unveiled Tally, a robot that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers during regular business hours and ensures not, as might be expected, that the aisles are free from grime and rubbish, but that goods are adequately stocked, placed and priced.\nAdvocates for robotic automation routinely highlight the fact that, for the most part, robots cannot service or program themselves – yet. In theory, this will create new, highly-skilled jobs for technicians and programmers and other well-paid roles. Critics, on the other hand, warn that we mustn’t overlook the value of interpersonal skills at work. They say that society is not prepared for the upheaval that the downgrading of the human touch will bring.\nFew people understand this tension better than world expert on the commercial applications of robotics technology, Dr Jing Bing Zhang. As research director for global marketing intelligence firm IDC, Zhang investigates the way in which robotics is shaping tomorrow’s working population. A recent report by Zhang and his team regarding general trends says that within two years almost one-third of robots will be smarter, more efficient robots, which are capable of collaborating with other robots and working safely alongside humans. Within three years, 30% or more of the world’s leading companies will have a designated chief robotics officer, and several governments around the world will have drafted or implemented specific legislation surrounding robots. Within five years, average salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60% – yet more than one-third of the available jobs in robotics will remain vacant due to shortages of skilled workers. ‘Automation and robotics will definitely impact lower-skilled people, which is unfortunate,’ Zhang told me via phone from his Singapore office. ‘I think the only way for them to move up or adapt is not to hope that the government will protect their jobs from technology, but look for ways to retrain themselves. No one can expect to do the same thing for life. That’s just not the case any more.’\nMeanwhile, developments in motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will inevitably give rise to an entirely new class of robots aimed predominantly at consumer markets – robots the likes of which we have never seen before. Upright, bipedal robots that live alongside us in our homes; robots that interact with us in increasingly sophisticated ways – in short, robots that were once the sole province of the realms of science fiction. This, according to Zhang, represents an unparalleled opportunity for companies positioned to take advantage of this shift. Yet it also poses significant challenges, such as the necessity for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.\nWith millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow. In an increasingly unstable employment market, developed nations desperately need more science, technology, engineering and maths – commonly abbreviated as STEM – graduates to remain competitive.",

    "text": "When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents gave her and her brother Jamie the freedom to decide what they did in their spare time. Vicky chose to do lots of different sports. She was a good swimmer, and the coach at the swimming club she went to thought she might be good enough to become a champion. But the club was a long way from her home so it was difficult for her to fit in the training around her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought himself a special track racing bike and started taking part in competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it for herself. She says that was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing really well. The track was near her school, which meant it was no problem for her to attend training sessions after school every day.\nVicky went on to have a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, when she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky told me: ‘For years I’d loved winning competitions but I began to get a bit tired of the whole thing – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I went on to have a new career.’\nVicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to learn to believe in themselves and their own abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it gets young people together so they’re part of a wider group.’\nThe charity uses celebrities to advertise the work they do. Vicky says, ‘I know some people aren’t sure whether the support of a celebrity is always positive for a charity. They say the celebrities are only doing it to push themselves forward, which prevents the public from seeing the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors, for example, can help, I think they should.’",

    "title": "What is psychology?\nAnd what’s the best way to study it?",
    "text": "In 1890 William James, the American philosopher and physician and one of the fathers of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ‘science of mental life’ and this definition provides a good starting point for our understanding even today.  We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means but, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.  Like most psychologists, James was particularly interested in human psychology, which he thought consisted of certain basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world which exists in time and space, and a way of knowing about these things.\nFor each of us this knowledge is primarily personal and private.  It comes from our own thoughts, feelings, and experience of the world, and may or may not be influenced by scientific facts about these things.  For this reason, it is easy for us to make judgements about psychological matters using our own familiarity as a touchstone.  We behave as amateur psychologists when we offer opinions on complex psychological phenomena, such as whether brain-washing works, or when we promote as facts our opinions about why other people behave in the ways they do: think they are being insulted, feel unhappy, or suddenly give up their jobs.  However, problems arise when two ordinary people comprehend things differently.  Formal psychology attempts to provide methods for deciding which explanations in a given situation are most likely to be correct, or for determining the circumstances under which each applies.  The work of psychologists helps us to distinguish between thoughts which are purely subjective, and may be biased and unreliable, and the facts: between our preconceptions and what is ‘true’ in scientific terms.\nPsychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind or brain, but although psychologists do study the brain, they do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.  Indeed, it is rarely possible to study the brain directly.  So, psychologists have discovered more by studying our behaviour, and by using their observations to derive hypotheses about what is going on inside us.\nA difficulty inherent in the study of psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the workings of the mind are not observable in the way that those of an engine are.  In everyday life, they can only be perceived indirectly, and have to be inferred from what can be observed, i.e. behaviour.  The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle.  It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues.  Furthermore, the clues themselves have to be derived from careful observation, based on accurate measurement, analysed with all possible scientific rigour, and interpreted using logical and reasoned arguments which can be subjected to public scrutiny.\nComplex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.  Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies.  Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.  Psychological findings have been useful in fields as varied as developing more effective methods in teaching children to read, in designing control panels for machines that reduce the risk of accidents, and in alleviating the suffering of people who are emotionally distressed by helping them to better communicate their feelings. \nAlthough psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been investigated scientifically in the past 150 years.  Early psychologists relied on introspection – the reflection of the individual’s own conscious experience – to find answers to psychological questions.\nThese early investigations aimed to identify mental structures, and although this is still of central interest to psychologists today, using introspection as a method of study, while worth considering, has obvious limitations.  As Sir Francis Galton pointed out, ‘… it leaves one a helpless spectator of but a minute fraction of automatic brain work’.  Attempting to grasp the mind through introspection, according to William James, is like ‘turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks’.   Contemporary psychologists therefore prefer to base their theories on careful observations of the phenomena in which they are interested, such as the behaviour of others rather than on reflections upon their own experience.",

    "title": "From discus-thrower to American footballer\nLawrence Okoye talks to reporter Sam Jenkins about his hopes of playing football in the National Football League (NFL) in the USA.",
    "text": "It’s a long way from London to Atlanta and, at his new American home, Lawrence Okoye steps back to consider the latest stage in an amazing sporting journey. He might be full of confidence but even he seems mildly stunned by the distance he has travelled from an Olympic final in the discus to the brink of another transformation. Despite never having played American football before, Lawrence appears likely to be picked for one of the major USA teams. \nIn Atlanta, Lawrence is still working out the exact responsibilities of his unfamiliar position. The idea that a 21-year-old novice from London might feature in this year’s selection for one of the biggest teams in American sport, is outrageous. But Lawrence specialises in demolishing disbelief. After being offered a place at Oxford University to study law, he postponed taking it up to train seriously for the discus, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, Lawrence was ranked the world’s fourth-best discus-thrower.\nLawrence had originally travelled to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training. He had been intent on preparing himself for the world championships. ‘Yeah,’ Lawrence says when asked to confirm the veracity of his sudden leap into a potentially huge NFL contract. ‘American football was in the back of my mind but it was only when I got to the USA that I made the decision to give it a try. When I was at school in London I also had these thoughts but they seemed crazy at the time.\nSoon after arriving in America he read about the NFL’s trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played the game, did he just imagine he would be good enough to be chosen to attend the Atlanta trials? ‘Pretty much,’ Lawrence says simply. ‘I went on the site and applied. He must have been nervous – being tested alongside men steeped in American football their whole lives? ‘No,’ he says. ‘Not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.’ He is not an effusive talker yet there’s no mistaking his conviction in his abilities. The bare statistics he provided in various tests and drills ensured that he was picked out as the most impressive player. ‘I was very chuffed to hear that.’ It was the one time that any sign of pride in his talents was evident in Lawrence’s expression.\nYet there is caution, too. Lawrence himself is without even the most basic experience. How can such a raw recruit make it into an NFL team? ‘From what coaches have told me, I’ve got all the attributes you need. It’s just about how hard I work,’ he replies. Will he be as chilled out as he waits to hear whether he has been selected? ‘I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Lots of people are saying I’m definitely going to be selected but I’m not too bothered.’\nThis apparent unconcern might have its roots in the disastrous Olympic discus final when he came last. He appears to have recovered from this scarring experience and now takes pleasure in the fact that he qualified for the final, securing his place with an impressive last throw. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he says. ‘The final didn’t pan out as I would’ve liked but that’s part of sport. It’s something I can return to.’ After his Olympic disappointment, there was speculation that Lawrence had allowed a momentous occasion to diminish him. Lawrence refuses to comment.\nA minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year and so the economic incentives are plain. So, Lawrence has swapped rugby for athletics and now American football. For all his prodigious physical gifts, would it not be better to just concentrate on one? ‘I can understand why someone would say that,’ he responds. ‘I’m trying to accomplish something I’ve dreamed about since I was that schoolkid.  And if it doesn’t work out I can go straight back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been calculated.’",

    "title": "Family Road Trips\nBy Ben Robinson, aged 16",
    "text": "I’m just going to say this once, for the record: when you’re travelling by car somewhere with your family, even when you’re six years old, the chances are you know full well that you’re not ‘there yet,’ even as you’re asking over and over ‘Are we there yet?’ And anyway, the truth of the matter is, once you get there it’s not ‘there’ anymore, is it? It’s ’here’. So if you really think there’s a chance that you’re ‘there’ yet, you should be asking ’Are we here yet? ’ And I’m pretty sure there’s no one who wishes they were ‘there yet’ more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.\nI mean, seriously – what are us kids complaining about? Just think about it. Wouldn’t you prefer to be lounging in the back seat, with nothing being demanded of you? So you watch endless DVDs that you’ve never seemed to get round to seeing before, listen to music, perhaps indulge in a few of the puzzles you’ve had for ages but not done, as the scenic vistas roll on by endlessly outside the window?\nAnd acting as co-pilot in the passenger seat, map in hand, there’ll be mum or dad, whose function is to dole out juice boxes, and cookies, or to adjust the radio station and temperature to whatever is requested – in short, to keep it all running smoothly and be the on-the-road concierge! Are we there yet? I hope not.\nThat is, of course, until someone in the car does something unthinkable – in my case generally my younger brother, Tim.  Something like … putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can’t do that! So I put my foot on his side. And then it’s his other foot, and then a hand, and next thing you know he’s hurled his whole body over into my space and a fight has erupted. And the driver and co-pilot start reaching back and separating us as the car accelerates and swerves.\nThey heatedly tell the younger sibling off, saying he should stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This restores civility for a while. And the scenic wonders, steeped in history, continue rolling by. \nAnd pretty soon after that, I’m trying to read, and suddenly I feel something – a draught blowing across my arm. But the car’s not going that fast and the window’s not even open. So where’s it coming from? My vengeful sibling is in the next seat, discreetly but purposefully channeling his breath onto me. He’s on his side, perfectly legitimately, not touching me – so he’s got me on a technicality. Just breathing? What’s the problem with that? The anger escalates. Tim gets yelled at, there’s more swerving. Then slowly the madness subsides again – for now.\nOver the years, Dad’s developed strategies for dealing with us kids on the back seat. For example, his response to the question ‘Are we there yet?’ has frequently been, ‘Yup. We’re here. Get out of the car.’\n‘But Dad. We’re still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour.’\n‘Oh, well, then maybe we’re not there yet.’ That kept everyone quiet for a while. Mind you, you can tell when you’re finally ‘there’ when you see the grown-ups tumble out of the car and go as far away as they can from the kids who’ve tormented them for all those hours. So once and for all, please note: if mum and dad are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You’re not there yet.",

    "text": "I’m Gina D’Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. We don’t just sell flowers to people buying them for friends or for their homes; all kinds of customers want flowers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in Reception, and sometimes we take part in photo sessions for businesses by providing flowers for their advertising pictures. Once I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It took a huge amount of work but I was really proud of the job we’d done. \nMy day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then and my friends think I must be crazy, but it’s never bothered me – I’m excited about what I do. It’s often colder than I’d like, and it’s usually dark, but you can’t expect anything else at that time in the morning, so I don’t let it worry me. \nThe flower market’s wonderful, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make decision-making challenging. If I was choosing for myself, I’d probably only get pink ones – it’s my favourite colour. But I mustn’t forget that what I love and what other people want aren’t necessarily the same thing. It isn’t always possible to find customers’ choices – not all flowers are available all year. I’m not so keen on having to argue about prices with the flower-sellers but it’s a necessary part of the job. Flowers aren’t cheap, so I have to try to get the best price possible.\nBack at the shop we look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then we get on with creating bunches of flowers and working out how much orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. Some people might think this sounds like too much trouble, but I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things – I wouldn’t want any other job!",

    "title": "Multitasking\nIn the social media era, we’re all required to do several things at once. But this constant multitasking is taking its toll. Neuroscientist Daniel J Levitin talks about our addiction to technology and its impact.",
    "text": "Our brains are busier than ever before. We’re assaulted with facts, pseudo facts, jibber-jabber, and rumour, all posing as information which we have to sift through and find out what we need to know and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are all doing more. Thirty years ago, travel agents made our airline reservations and salespeople helped us find what we needed in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We’re doing the work of 10 different people while still trying to keep up with our lives, our families, our careers, our hobbies and our favourite TV shows, and helping us do all this is our smartphones. They’ve become part of the 21st-century mania for cramming as much as possible into every single spare moment.\nBut there’s a fly in the ointment. Although we think we’re multitasking – doing several things at once – this is a powerful and dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and world expert on divided attention, says that our brains are ‘not wired to multitask well … . When people think they’re multitasking, they’re actually switching from one task to another very rapidly. And every time they do, there’s a cognitive cost in doing so.’ So we’re not actually keeping a lot of balls in the air like expert jugglers; we’re more like amateur plate spinners, frantically switching from one task to another, ignoring the one that’s not right in front of us but worried it’ll come crashing down any minute. Even though we think we’re getting a lot done, ironically, multitasking makes us demonstrably less efficient.\nMultitasking has been found to increase the production of the stress hormone cortisol as well as the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline, which can overstimulate your brain and cause mental fog or scrambled thinking. Multitasking creates a sort of craving, effectively rewarding the brain for losing focus and for constantly searching for external stimulation. To make matters worse, the area of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex has a novelty bias, meaning that its attention can be easily hijacked by something new – the proverbial shiny objects that we use to entice infants, for example. The irony here for those of us who are trying to focus amid competing activities is clear; the very brain region we need to rely on for staying on task is easily distracted.\nJust having the opportunity to multitask is detrimental to cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, former Visiting Professor of Psychology at Gresham College, London, calls it info-mania. His research found that being in situations where you’re trying to focus on a task when an email sits unread in your inbox reduces your effective Intelligence Quotient (IQ) by almost 10 points. Wilson showed that the cognitive losses from multitasking are even greater than those caused by fatigue.\nRuss Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, found that learning new information while multitasking causes the information to go to the wrong part of the brain. If students do their homework and watch TV at the same time, for instance, the information from their schoolwork goes into the striatum, a specialised region for storing new procedures and skills, as opposed to facts and ideas. Without the distraction of TV, the information goes into the hippocampus, where it’s organised and categorised in a variety of ways, making it easier to retrieve.\nTo make matters worse, lots of multitasking requires decision-making: ‘Do I answer this text message or ignore it? How do I respond to this?’ It turns out that decision-making is also very hard on our brains, and that little decisions appear to take up the same level of neural resources as big ones. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which, after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important.\nIn discussing information overload with business leaders, top scientists and writers, email comes up again and again as a problem. It’s not a philosophical objection to email itself, but rather the mind-numbing volume of communication that comes in. When the 10-year-old son of my neuroscience colleague was asked what his father does for a living, he responded, ‘He answers emails.’ My colleague admitted that it’s not so far from the truth. We feel obliged to reply to our emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get anything else done.",

    "text": "Starting out with only basic fashion knowledge, Julie Deane has created a successful business with her ‘satchels’  - a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. These satchels now sell in world-famous shops, and are the bag chosen by many celebrities. \nBefore choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses, from cake decorating to party planning, considering her options, rather than going with her first idea. Once she’d decided, she found not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, ‘Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.’ She involved family from the start, working with her mother, who’d never had a career, but has a natural business ability, and the design came from children’s story books.\nAlthough Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, they’ve been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they’d comment in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed her company produces the satchels. Julie now loves waiting to see which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for original styles, keeping her products new and exciting.\nThere was a challenging time when a company producing satchels copied Julie’s design to sell similar products, as a result she now makes sure she’s as confident in the production team as she is in her own staff. Visitors comment on the positive feeling in her offices – people love working there, There’s now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it’s the team who make it a special place. ",

    "title": "Cycling Home from Siberia, by Robert Lilwall",
    "text": "We had been flying east all night and I awoke to notice that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window onto the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, it had not yet started showing in Siberia. I could see no sign of human life and the view rolled away in an otherworldly blend of mountains, streams and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head.\nMy neighbour woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ‘Good morning, Robert’ he said, pronouncing my name in a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation in order to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary I had managed to explain to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because it was my intention to return home to England by bicycle. ‘But, Robert,’ he had reasoned with me, ‘there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.’ I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road, though not many people used it these days.\n‘Alone?’ he asked, pointing at me.\n‘No, I will be riding with a friend called Al.’\n‘Just one friend?’\n‘Yes just one,’ I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and with just one word ‘Holodna’ (cold) he pointed outside. I tried to bolster my case by explaining to Sergei with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I left out the fact that, because my trip was self-funded I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment had been brought at slashed prices. In reality, I was not at all sure they would be up to the job. This was especially true of my enormous postman’s over-trousers which I had bought for £10.\nIt had all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall that morning was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes, without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ‘Well, why not?’ I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ‘Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.’ In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to decipher my scrawl, scratched his head, wrote something and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ‘OK’, it said.\nIt was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job did tick many important boxes for me. It was frequently challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling and, of course there were great long holidays in which to chase adventures. Twice since I had started teaching I had used these holidays to go to meet Al. He had caught the adventuring-bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and so had decided to do something far more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world.\nEver since that first ride we had taken together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times he thought that the ride, or the road, would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the sceptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day and it made him feel alive.",

    "title": "Life online – What is it doing to us?\nJodie Woods’ father was worried about the impact that her use of social media might be having on \nher. So 16-year-old Jodie decided to investigate what the experts think.",
    "text": "‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online.  You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad.  He’s difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it’s quite interesting. Generally, research seems to show that most of us – teenagers, I mean – who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media – dipping in and out to buy airline tickets or check e-mails as adults do – they inhabit it. That’s neither good nor bad – it’s what you do with it that counts.’\nHow does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s ‘the modern equivalent of hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger, to share the in-jokes and catch up on the gossip: a kind of virtual youth club.’ He says it performs a similar function: ‘helping teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learning to deal with teenage issues and get on with their peers.’\nPsychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity: you can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things. Research actually shows that keen social networkers are not as self-absorbed as others who don’t use social media.’ He says that embracing social media can help if you’re not outgoing: ‘Computer-mediated communication can be more comfortable than face-to-face, and there may be benefits from practising social skills in a less threatening environment.’\nProfessor Andrew Phillips is researching the use of social networking sites by younger people.  He feels they can help if you’re a quiet person with a specialised interest because they allow you to connect with others with similar interests.  ‘If you’re one of only three people in your school who’s into a particular type of music, traditionally you would have felt quite isolated.  But if you discover a social networking group of like-minded people, there’s suddenly a necessary critical mass and you can still be popular, just in a different context,’ he says.\nPauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: ‘It’s people your age who are able to find new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals – and then create their own content – who are really harnessing the potential of social networks.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting and blogging about the things that interest us.  Photo-sharing sites, she says, are transforming creativity.  Keen photographers can network with each other, learn skills, swap images and deepen their own interest.\n‘This all adds to employability and will undoubtedly be of benefit in the workplace,’ she says.  ‘Every business is using social media to sell and to increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works and can create customers.  For example, if you develop a product and you have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers for that product.  If you link all those networks together, there’s your customer base.’\nTeenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work, agrees Matthews. ‘One of the fantastic aspects of many sites is the opportunity for collaborating with others to create content and then share it with others.  Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill, and an important part of being employable in a digital age.’",

    "title": "The food scientist\nAlice Baines meets the influential food scientist Charles Spence",
    "text": "Charles Spence will eat just about anything. ‘We’ve got ice cream made from bee larvae at home,’ says the Professor of Experimental Psychology in his office at Oxford University in the UK. They may be maggoty in appearance, but they apparently have a ‘slightly nutty, floral’ flavour. How to make bug-eating acceptable is just one of the many gustatory challenges that Spence and his team are tackling. Through his studies into how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour, Spence is influencing, in a stealthy but not inconsiderable manner, what we eat and drink, from the hefty output of food-industry giants (he sits on the scientific advisory board of one well-known multinational conglomerate, and receives funding from another), to the menus of leading restaurants.\nSpence and his peers have, through a line of scientific inquiry that is informally referred to as gastro physics, studied in minute detail how we experience food and drink. Who we eat with; how food is arranged and described; the colour, texture and weight of plates and cutlery; background noise – all these things affect taste. Spence’s book, The Perfect Meal, written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite.\nWere you aware that the person in a group who orders first in a restaurant enjoys their food most? And did you realise that we consume about 35% more food when eating with one other person, rising to 75% more when dining with three others?\nSpence’s lab in Oxford is noticeably un-space-age. ‘Low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff,’ he readily admits. There are soundproof booths that resemble human-sized safes (‘most of my PhD was done in one of those,’ he says fondly), along with stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. By keeping overheads low, he can afford to work more creatively with cooks who can’t fund academic research themselves. Much of his work is funded by a major food multinational. Historically, he says, undertaking research which attracts industry funding has been seen in university circles as ‘what you do if you can’t do proper science’. But since the government insisted that universities demonstrate their work has an impact and that people are interested in it, this type of research has become a strategically good thing to do.\nSpence is currently helping famous brands through (often government-imposed) reductions in salt and sugar. It is in their interests, he points out, to help loyal customers stay alive for longer. Perhaps surprisingly, many have been making these reductions furtively, behind closed doors. They do it gradually, so regular consumers don’t notice the difference from one pack to the next. ‘The research shows that when you tell people what you’re doing, it makes them focus on the taste and for whatever reason they don’t like it as much,’ he says.\nIt was while working on a project for a major food producer that Spence was first introduced to Heston Blumenthal, the renowned experimental chef. ‘At the time, people thought: “Science and food – that’s horrible,” although most food is scientific, in fact. Who better to change the mindset than Heston?’ It was through Blumenthal’s collaborations with Spence, who had been studying the effects of sound on flavour, that the ‘Sound of the Sea’ dish came about in Blumenthal’s five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence says that members of the early-twentieth-century art movement, the Italian futurists, were ‘doing sounds of croaking frogs with frogs legs a century ago’, but that it didn’t catch on.\nNow the food industry is applying Spence’s sensory science to products left, right and centre. This includes his recent findings that higher-pitched music enhances sweetness, and lower-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter. ‘It’s always surprising when shapes affect taste, or when a tune can impact on how you perceive a flavour,’ he says. An airline will soon be matching music with food served to passengers. And last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played a concerto while your ice-cream softens; they omitted to match the music to the taste, though, which is all too frequently the case according to Spence.\nWhat, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? There was the time they ate rabbit, with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. And the one at which they played with remote-controlled, multi-coloured light bulbs. ‘We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones and 10 different drinks lined up to see whether they have different pitches.’ Home, sweet shops, food conventions, international gastronomy conferences: they’re all extensions of the lab to Spence.",

    "title": "Big Ideas in Science\nNew scientific discoveries are showing just how little we really know about the universe we live in",
    "text": "A while back, some scientists began a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? which used a mixture of documentary and drama to show there’s a lot about our universe we don’t understand. \nHow could any scientist argue with that? They can be a bit arrogant sometimes, but not even the most gung-ho physicist would claim to possess all the keys to the cosmos. Even so, some felt moved to issue public warnings about the film, describing it in terms ranging from the peremptory (‘atrocious’) through to the darkly disturbing (‘It is a very dangerous piece of work’). Clearly, this was a must-see movie. Yet, for the first twenty minutes or so, I couldn’t see what all the fuss was about. Various scientists made pretty innocuous statements about how new discoveries were revealing the universe to be far stranger than anyone had expected.\nIt was when the film moved on to describe some of these discoveries that I did, at last, begin to see what the fuss was really about – discoveries like the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. I had heard rumours before of how a Japanese researcher had shown that the very shape of a water molecule could be radically altered just by the thoughts of those around it. Yet when the movie described this astonishing discovery, all it gave by way of evidence was some pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and nasty after being exposed to someone in a bad mood.  \nNow, lots of people do find this kind of evidence pretty compelling. It’s immediate, clear, and apt to prompt wide smiles and uncritical sentiments from the ill-informed, like ‘Hey, man, far out’. Among scientists, though, the typical response has been: ‘Give me a break’. I know what they mean. Sure, the idea that water is affected by thoughts is an amazing claim with huge implications. With no obvious explanation, it also raises the possibility of radical new forces at work in the cosmos. But before we get too carried away, it might be an idea to have some decent proof that the effect is real. And pretty photos of crystals, nice as they undoubtedly are, just don’t cut it. \nThe real problem is that the movie’s claims weren’t bizarre enough. Try this: water molecules owe their properties to a form of energy that appears literally out of nowhere, which appears to be linked to a force now propelling the expansion of the whole universe. And the evidence is more than just a few pretty pictures; it comes from decades of research in laboratories and observatories around the world. The truth is that discoveries are now being made which prove beyond doubt that – just as the film claims – the universe is far stranger than anyone could have believed. Astronomers have found that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter, and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as ‘dark energy’. \nThe movie aside, discoveries being made on a more down to earth level are no less astounding. Neuroscientists have found evidence that our conscious perception of events lags behind reality by around half a second – a delay we fail to notice because it is deliberately edited out by our brains. Anthropologists now believe they have identified the birthplace of modern humans, and how – and why – they left it to populate the world. And, completing the cosmic circle, some theorists claim to have found links between the existence of life – including ours – on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe. \nDespite what some might have us believe, science shows no signs of reaching completion. On the contrary, we appear to be further away from omniscience than ever. It is now clear that many, if not most, natural phenomena can never be understood to the level once believed possible. The emergence of the concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have put unavoidable bounds on what we can know. This has culminated in the efforts of some of the world’s leading theoretical physicists to create the so-called Theory of Everything, which will sum up all the forces and particles of the universe in a single equation. Theories apart, many of us believe the universe is best summed up in a single word: incredible.",

    "title": "Doing research",
    "text": "One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK, and internationally, over the last years has been a move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible in their study. This recognises that research is not an exclusive activity for established, world-famous scholars at ancient universities or for the scientists who are pushing the boundaries of our knowledge concerning, for example, medical practice, but that it can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way in which we go about building knowledge and skills. Research approaches and skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in employment, because they are ways of thinking about the world, as well as ways of going about your own work.\nAs a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not digest it and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted. Instead, you wonder Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? What do we really make of whatever facts we are given, views we are meant to adopt, or beliefs we are told about? Why does it matter? These and others are the most common questions that underlie what we call research. \nBy research, I am suggesting a continuum of approaches and activities which can be defined at one end of the continuum as the ‘blue skies’, groundbreaking, highly complex, intellectual, world-shattering, erudite research, which is the traditional view of research carried out full-time by the highly trained few, and leading to substantial change and knowledge. Research has to begin somewhere, though, and at the other end of the continuum, we can define research as a relatively everyday enquiry approach which has a robust research design, involves much careful work and, amongst other things, problematises or asks thoughtful questions about issues, practices, events and fields; follows up hunches; and makes practical suggestions.\nMost students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will have been asking questions which led to the need to carry out some investigation, some research, since you first became interested in studying at all. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.\nAt college and in higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas that you read about or hear about, and constructing your own responses and your own knowledge to add to the debates are all learning activities which are expected of you. Some students may have difficulties with this, as knowledge is seen in some parts of the world as being already established, so that you gain knowledge by listening to and deferring to authority in the form of the teacher and texts. It could seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and known authorities, and you might feel you need to be told what it is important to learn about. But the fact is that in UK, US, much European, and Australasian higher education, established knowledge is to be questioned, as are those who claim to be authorities. Some of this enquiring and knowledge construction might well seem quite daunting.\nCritical thinking is particularly important in research. The research of others is useful to all of us as students, academics, and beyond in the world of employment, but we need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence. We must not make the mistake of depending uncritically upon facts and information which we are given by others in our reading, or verbally.",

    "title": "Martin Cabello – young photographer",
    "text": "Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. And when I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. Actually, many other young photographers before me had done the same thing, but it seemed like a really great idea to me, and so I started.\nAfter a few weeks I decided to put these photos onto a website for young photographers because I was keen to create a photo diary, and also to have the chance to show other people my photos. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better – and I agreed.\nSo I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was very different to what many other young photographers were doing – they were all taking colour photos. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices.\nOne day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.",

    "title": "Writer Eleanor Catton\nOur reporter met author Eleanor Catton to discuss her book The Luminaries.",
    "text": "When a novel is described as ambitious, it’s usually a kind way of suggesting a degree of failure. Not so with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK at a time when the book’s success had placed her at the centre of a publicity whirlwind, but she seemed very calm especially considering she was still in her twenties. She had just flown in from Germany, and was flying home to New Zealand the following day. She told me a story of once being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel up against the glass. The official peered at it and asked, ‘Well, what’s it about?’\nNot a simple question for an author. The Luminaries is set during the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have been committed, and a council of 12 men has convened to solve them. The plot then becomes incredibly complex. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal wth. At more than 800 pages, it is ‘big by necessity’, because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters ‘a decent show’.\nWhen I ask how it feels to be so successful at such a young age, she answers with a neat deflection. ‘It’s so nice coming from a small country in times like this, because everybody feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a very familial feeling at home, I got a lot of back pats from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, carefully: ‘What is annoying is when it is assumed that what I’m trying to do in the book is not a philosophical enterprise.’\n‘I lit upon this idea that I wanted to try and write the book in the shape of a spiral. Every part was half the length of the part before it,’ said Catton. It literally speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters whether the reader notices these things. ‘What I wanted to create with The Luminaries is a book that had structural patterns built in that didn’t matter, but if you cared about them, you could look into the book and see them.’\nDespite the experimental structure of The Luminaries, the book remains an exciting murder mystery with an absorbing plot. Surprisingly for anyone who’s read the novel, she says she didn’t work out what it would be beforehand. ‘I just would try and write myself into a corner, and then see how imaginative I could be in writing myself out of this impossible situation I’d created for myself.’  Refreshingly, it’s clear one of her goals was also to make the book fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of television drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries wields cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints and dialogue. I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says.\nHer conversation bubbles with enthusiasm, punctuated with a low, conspiratorial laugh. She lights up when talking about her craft, and about New Zealand. ‘I always notice when I come over to Britain how much the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to extremely populated areas, to have that saturation of other human beings.’ But for the time being at least, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I am not alone in hoping it provides her with the inspiration she needs for man other novels.",

    "text": "Where should we look for the mind?  This might sound like an odd question: surely, thinking takes place inside people’s heads.  Nowadays, we even have sophisticated neuroimaging techniques to prove it.  As deeply intuitive as this assumption about the boundaries of the mind may be, I see no compelling reason why the study of the mind should stop at the skin or the skull.  There is an abundance of evidence, ranging from earliest prehistory to the present, to testify that things, as well as neurons, participate in human cognitive life.  From the viewpoint of archaeology, it is clear that stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.  Consequently, I suggest that what is outside the head may not necessarily be outside the mind.\nIt is easy to see how the mind and the brain became equated.  Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them.  This makes good sense if you are a neuroscientist, because of the constraints imposed by using a brain-scanning machine.  But as a result, it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.  Naturally, I do not mean to question the neural basis of cognition, but to point out that mind is more than a brain.  Instead, it would be more productive to explore the hypothesis that human intelligence ‘spreads out’ beyond the skin into culture and the material world.  \nThis is where a new theory I’ve developed – Material Engagement Theory (MET) – comes in.  At its heart, MET aims to explore the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body, such as when one makes numbers and symbols out of clay, or uses a stone to strike another, forming a tool.  It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory, and what those changes mean for the ways we think.  This approach gives a new insight into what minds are, and what they are made of, by changing what we know about what things do for the mind.\nThink of a blind person with a stick.  Where does this person’s self begin?  The unity of the blind man and the stick offers a way to conceptualise minds and things as continuous, but it also provides an analogy for the profound plasticity of the human mind: using a stick, the blind man turns touch into sight, but the stick has its own interesting active role.  Tactile sensation is projected onto the point of contact between the tip of the stick and the outside environment.  As a result, the brain treats the stick as part of the body.\nThe blind man’s stick reminds us of something that many people forget; namely, that it is in the nature of human intelligence to remain amenable to drastic, deep reorganisation by incorporating new technological innovations.  My approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution.  It is important to keep in mind that, whatever actual form the ‘stick’ might have taken in the history of our species – from the earliest Palaeolithic stone tools to the internet – its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary.  Through the ‘stick’, the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward.\nThat is why a stick used by a monkey to retrieve food is of a different kind.  For humans, ‘sticks’ are used to satisfy our desire to know.  This unique human predisposition for engagement with material culture explains why we humans, more than any other species, make things, and how those things, in return, make our minds what they are.  I call that metaplasticity – we have plastic minds that develop and change as they interact with the material world.  I want to put materiality back into the cognitive equation.  MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture, from the stone hand-axe to the latest smartphone, may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think.  Mind-changing technology has a futuristic, sci-fi ring to it, but what most people don’t realise is that humans have used it since they first evolved.",

    "title": "A career in the video games industry?\nReporter Lauren Cope finds out about working in the video games industry.",
    "text": "Initially populated by computer scientists and the self-taught, the game design industry used not to offer many routes into its midst. Often, perhaps unfairly, viewed as just a hobby for young enthusiasts, the video games industry is now being taken seriously. Surprised? Industry experts aren’t.\nIt’s not easy though. Video game spin-offs that rapidly follow any new movie require dozens of team members and months of incredible skill, perseverance and intricacies. As with almost every industry, it’s tricky to get into – but it is expanding. Jim Donelly, a spokesman for an online games magazine says: ‘It’s certainly very difficult to make much headway within big companies, or to influence any of the really big mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.’\nSo, how can you get into such a competitive industry? Although many companies prefer people  to have a degree in computer science, Jim disagrees. ‘There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something, and you won’t get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff. Game design is less a job than it is a way of life. Like any creative endeavour it must be done to be real.’ Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s really more complicated than that. There are lots of people who want to work in games, but few who measure up to the requirements of the industry these days; even fewer who have the creative talent, technical know-how, vision and entrepreneurial ability to really contribute to the ever-changing face of an evolving medium.’\nCan you do it on your own? ‘Perhaps, but it’s pretty tricky,’ says John. ‘However, a good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. Most games designers start their careers as programmers, or artists, progressing their way up the ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment media, plus have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. They may or may not have spent a few years in the working world post-graduation, but have realised that games is going to be their “thing”. They are not merely fans, but are fascinated by the future possibilities of games, and are aware of the increasing breadth and diversity of the form. And finally connections can help. This is often overlooked, but in order to get ahead in games – as in many other areas – you need to network.’\nThe childish stereotype of the adolescent boy glued to his games console has long been replaced by the more accurate perception of a grown-up medium, grabbing our attention. Families frequently get involved on interactive consoles. Smart phones introduce a wealth of new games through apps, as well as social media. John believes there is plenty of room for expansion. ‘Games have become pervasive play-things for increasingly large audiences. They are also a great way to learn things and I see this already big area as an expanding array of possibilities and opportunities.’",

    "title": "Board games\nDan Jolin reports on a type of board game called 'Eurogames'.",
    "text": "John and Zuzi Morgan have set up a café in Oxford, in the UK, where people can not only enjoy a cup of coffee and some cake, but play a board game too. The owners’ hope is that people enjoy the experience so much they want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a \nfull-time business: ‘There’s so much technology. Everybody’s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.’ The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's café are known as ‘Eurogames’. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building.\nThe first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan (later rebranded Catan), created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, keeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion, with none of the players feeling left out. That crucial factor was refined in the ‘co-operative' games that followed, in which every player wins or loses as a team member, provoking a lot more social interaction.\nPandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming’s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. ‘When I played that with friends we got scared,’ recalls Leacock. ‘There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.’\nLeacock’s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. ‘Games were my favourite birthday gift,’ he says, ‘but I’d get very excited, open up the box, then we’d play and there would just be crushing disappointment.’ So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards of the many games they played together and try to design something better using the same components.\nPandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design. It incorporates, Leacock explains, ‘a tremendous amount of storytelling. It’s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. It is an unfolding story.’\nThe growth of the video games industry has, perhaps contrary to expectations, been one of the biggest factors in the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games – largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing. ‘Video games and board games have learned an awful lot from each other,’ says Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company. ‘Everyone’s a mobile gamer now. Speak to anyone who’s got a smartphone, they’ve got at least one game they like to play on it. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.’\nFor a time, video-gaming offered a level of physical social interaction, at the arcade or through multi-player sofa games that friends or family members could play at the same time, in the same room. Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. So some people who had previously enjoyed playing video games started looking for a way of playing games again with other people who were physically present. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world and this trend is set to continue.",

    "text": "Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School.  ‘I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,’ she told it, pleasantly.  Her mother was getting out of the other door at the time, so didn’t overhear, but Bonnie wouldn’t have cared if she had.  Her mother knew her feelings.  Mrs. Wyndham looked about her.  Almonside was a funny school, all bits and pieces, buildings hidden away amongst the trees on a wooded hillside; very confusing at first sight.  Then she saw the signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre…\n‘Riding centre,’ said Bonnie, showing a sudden interest.\n‘Headmaster’s study,’ said her mother. ‘This way.’\nBonnie followed her mother along a broad drive that curved between trees.\n‘I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,’ said Mrs. Wyndham wearily, but she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to do so.\nA few minutes later her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie herself sat and waited outside the door.  Suddenly Bonnie jumped up.  ‘Why should I just sit here?’ she said to herself.  ‘I’ll be thrown out before very long, anyway,’ she said mentally to the door, ‘so why not get it over and done with?’  She left the building and headed for the riding centre in the direction indicated by the sign.\nThere was a nice old building where the horses were kept, and a large structure for indoor riding.  Bonnie looked about her, but there was no-one in sight.  There was a certain reverence about her manner as she approached the animals.  Bonnie treated horses with respect.  The horses were very well looked after, she could tell that at once.Almost every stall was occupied, and she wandered along looking carefully at each horse and judging it.  ‘I know what they’re doing here,’ she told a small pony as she ran a finger along its nose. It was the next horse that pulled her up short.  ‘But aren’t you the best of the lot!’ she said.  He was brown with a touch of white.  Lively, probably, but Bonnie liked that.  ‘You know, I have the feeling we’ve met before,’ said Bonnie, stroking his neck.  ‘It was in my dreams and I was riding you to victory in some big competition…’  Over the stall was his name: Maverick.\nSuddenly, she couldn’t resist the temptation to ride the horse.  ‘I wonder where I can find a bridle for your head, and a saddle for your back.  Can’t be far away.’  The room containing all the riding equipment was – Bonnie was delighted to discover – unlocked.  Absorbed in the pleasurable task of putting a saddle on Maverick’s back, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster.  When she sat up high on the big horse outside the building, she felt like a queen, mistress of all she could see.  Her nickname at her previous school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed delightedly as she remembered it.  ‘You’re the best horse I’ve ever sat on, Maverick,’ she said admiringly, ‘and when I say that I’m not kidding, I can assure you, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.’\nShe nudged him into a walk, then into a trot.  ‘If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,’ she confided.  She went round and round the paddock.  The rhythm was exhilarating, a little breeze whipping smartly past her cheek and making it glow.  She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt certain that he’d jump well.",

    "text": "Chloe Morgan readily admits science, let alone Palaeontology, hadn’t held too much appeal for her, at least not until she was fifteen. Even then, it happened more by accident than design. ‘My younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase that’s so common among children, and which I hadn’t experienced. In fact, I tended to dismiss it. I reluctantly lent him a hand with a science project, and when I came across an article about some of the recent discoveries in the field, it just blew my mind. I knew immediately that this was something I wanted to commit myself to.’ \nI am curious to know what encouragement she got because Palaeontology was by no means a common career choice for young people at that time. ‘I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,’ she laughs. ‘This guy, Matt Cornelius, was famous already, despite being quite young. At first I was a nervous wreck, even though he had a reputation for being approachable and easy-going. I was still worried he’d think I was just an annoying kid pestering him with my questions. The whole thing could easily have been awkward and embarrassing,’ Chloe tells me. ‘But I felt more at ease when he showed so much patience and willingness to listen.’ \nI cannot resist bringing up the question of the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowns for a moment. ‘I have to admit that films such as Jurassic Park featuring dinosaurs created by special effects technology have led to a huge surge in public interest in these creatures, though not necessarily in Palaeontology more generally. However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading. What irritates me is that we're either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or rather geeky losers, figures of fun who don’t know how to relate to people. And films fail to represent accurately the everyday reality of our working lives.’ I ask her to explain.\n‘My job is remarkably varied. I spend lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also have to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications.’ \nWhile it's not necessarily something Chloe is required to do on a daily basis, there’s also the question of communicating scientific findings to the public, if time allows. The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. ‘There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don’t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it’s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.’ \nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. ‘I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period. We succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because we’ve learned such a tremendous amount about dinosaurs recently and the ones which are depicted in this programme are radically different to those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are easily the most life-like that have ever been portrayed.’ \nWhy does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain the focus of ongoing research?  ‘I suspect that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered. And Palaeontology is a great form of time travel.’",

    "text": "Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but needed to find a part-time job as my course was rather expensive. After considering several options, I trained to become a weekend tour guide in my home city – Chicago, USA. This involved taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised to discover how much I enjoyed giving those tours. I got to see the city that I’d been living in my whole life through the eyes of tourists, and it felt like a new experience every time!\nAfter finishing my studies I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. Although I thought it would be quite simple, in fact when I researched what I had to do, I found out that to get a licence as a full-time tour guide I needed to know a lot more than I’d learnt so far. All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city, covering everything from local architecture and history to the rules of public transport. After several challenging but interesting months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide.\nTour guiding isn’t just about knowing historical facts or making sure you don’t lose anyone from your group in the crowds. There are many other necessary skills. You should be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations, for example, if a place that you thought was open is actually closed when you arrive, or a route changes. Tourists don’t want to hear what the problems are or that they’re missing out on something, they just want to enjoy a well-organised tour. \nI need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job means that my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago.",

    "text": "Jordan Romero is 13 and plans to be the youngest person ever to climb Mount Everest.  If he makes it, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation.  Because young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, he hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains.  Or, at least, to venture outdoors.\nJordan’s team for the climb includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen.  ‘Team Romero’ they call themselves, and climbing Everest is only part of their goal.  If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits, the highest points on each continent.  Few people achieve this under the age of thirty.  Jordan has already climbed five of them and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.\nI have spoken to a number of well-known Everest climbers and could not find a single one who thought that taking a 13-year-old up the world’s highest mountain was a good idea.  They agreed that a young climber might have the necessary physical strength, but had doubts about whether a teenager would be emotionally strong enough.  In addition, they couldn’t see how a young person could have gained enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely.\nThe Romeros have heard such views before.  ‘I know that criticism is out there,’ Paul says, ‘but I can’t waste my time with it – there’s still so much to do.  I think about possible problems, obviously.  Karen and I weigh up the risks all the time, but we believe our own experience as climbers will help.  And watching Jordan develop gives me confidence.  He’s becoming so strong and grown-up.’\nI also wonder about Jordan’s motivation.  Is this just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme?  ‘This project isn’t about me trying to become famous for my son’s achievements,’ Paul insists.  ‘At first, he talked about it as something to do later in life, but when we discussed it, we thought: ‘Why not now?’  We talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn’t lost the motivation to do it.’  When I ask Jordan what pleasure he finds in the challenge he says, ‘I just focus on achieving my goal.’\nIn the past, few knew or cared about being the youngest or fastest person to climb a particular mountain, or sail a particular ocean.  Today, every adventure is blogged about, and every climb turns into a record-setting challenge.  The more adventurous the record, the more interest it generates.  This gives Jordan a dilemma.  We may complain that achievement too often replaces enjoyment during such challenges, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has got to play the media game.  This means blogging, sitting for photo shoots and giving interviews.  He has got to offer something spectacular.  Like climbing Everest.  ‘And you know what?’ Paul says.  ‘If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he’s done with mountain climbing and wants to play basketball instead, we’ll shut this whole project down and go to the gym.’",

    "title": "Being a volunteer in Thailand\n",
    "text": "My name’s Ella and I’m 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Despite being five years younger than me, our relationship isn’t too bad. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary – a place where people look after sick and rescued elephants. To be honest, I wasn’t sure at first if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was the first time we’d done anything like that before. In the end, though, there was no need to worry.\nOne of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect the elephants’ food. Elephants eat huge amounts of grass and banana plants, so collecting this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard work, but to see the elephants enjoying their meal meant that, for me, it was worth it. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found that so much fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants did! The part of the day I most looked forward to was the evening. By the light of the moon we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night.\nAll the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. That was our decision, though, as Josie didn’t want to be on her own.  It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we’d expected that. The meals were delicious – and didn’t include meat, which neither of us is keen on. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.\nNow that we’re back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she’s being completely honest. I think she’s probably a bit annoyed with herself now that she didn’t take full advantage of her time there because she was missing her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she’ll go back one day – I certainly will!",

    "title": "So you want to be a cartoonist?",
    "text": "People are always asking me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable – cartooning is one of those jobs you dream about as a little kid, like being a race car driver. But most people eventually throw these childish daydreams away and consider more realistic professions, like becoming a tax lawyer or a manufacturer of auto parts. The idea that you can support yourself financially at all, let alone maintain an adequate lifestyle, by sketching the sort of doodles commonly found in the margins of high school notebooks is, when you think about it, silly. Yet some people do exactly that.\nPeople don’t become cartoonists in precisely the same way, though it’s safe to say that most who do have wanted to do it for a long time. As for me, after having a fairly typical cartoonist’s childhood (obsessive love of comic strips, contributions to school publications, being known throughout school as ‘the kid who draws’), I happened to study graphic design in college and then, after graduating, went around different companies with a collection of illustrations. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who told me they were looking for political cartoons on local issues. I drew up a few ideas and they bought them; in a few months, I was selling enough to support myself. \nYou actually don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, you don't need much money, you don’t even really need to know how to draw. You just need your brain, your hand and something that makes a mark. But of course, if it really was that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are, say, teachers. The technical barriers to being a cartoonist are low, but it’s a tough job nevertheless. No one should attempt to enter the profession unless they feel that doing anything else would be impossible. After all, it’s so much easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves at least a little time for the family, home repairs and hobbies.\nThe more things you know how to do well, the more chance you have of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist and occasionally a designer. I don’t turn down anything – that’s because you can learn an awful lot even from work you don’t particularly want to do. It also doesn’t hurt to be intelligent, well-read and curious about everything around you. \nBut what about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when a significant number of cartoonists could find regular jobs doing cartoons for several different newspapers and magazines. But those days, if they aren’t gone, are rapidly passing. For almost everyone today, cartooning is an entrepreneurial activity – that means you're not just going to have to produce the work, you're going to have to sell it. The more comfortable you are with what that involves, the better you'll do. Time and time again, I've seen cartoonists with average creative abilities and excellent business skills do far better than those who were artistic geniuses but nothing else. \nIt amazes me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon in their life and yet are terrified someone will steal their ideas. Some of these people are so worried that they refuse to let others even look at their work! Legally, all you need to do to protect your stuff is draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright’ somewhere, put a circle around the letter, then write your name and the date next to it. But let’s face it – it's far more realistic that no one will be interested in your work. If, by some chance, someone steals a cartoon and it goes viral on the internet and everybody starts emailing it to their friends, it's not a disaster – it can be an extremely lucky break!",

Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer, a performer who supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Many people think that backing singers aren’t good enough to be lead singers. That’s not true – they have to be better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! \n‘What I love about my job is that when I walk into the recording studio I never know what I’ll be asked to sing,’ she says. ‘It could be classical, jazz, hiphop or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I’m often surprised by producers’ requests. I was once asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just get on with the job!’\n‘Excellent musical abilities are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There’s often no printed music to refer to. I’ll never forget my first experience of recording the background music to a film. It was very complicated as there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. I was terrified: I knew that if I got something wrong it would mean recording everything again, which nobody enjoys. Recording sessions are long enough as it is.’\n‘One of my favourite jobs is doing recordings for song-writers. Less experienced writers don’t always understand which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me performing their song they can work out for themselves how to improve it.’",

    "title": "Ellen MacArthur: 'I can't live with the sea any more'\nThe round-the-world record holder explains why she has turned her back on the sea to campaign for the planet",
    "text": "During her racing days, nothing mattered more to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, unless it was being the fastest person on its surface. It was her great obsession from childhood. With the boats that took her round the world, she had a kind of strange union. They worked as one. And when she was on land again, everyday life felt trivial, everyone pressed in too much to find out about the race, and she soon wanted to be out on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature even in places that had nearly destroyed her.\nAfter she came second in the Vendée Globe non stop, solo round-the-world race several years ago, she took me down into the tiny, unventilated cabin of her boat Kingfisher on a ‘tour’ of what had been her cell, home, work station and survival-capsule for 94 days. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning; how she worked out, to the last sheet, exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was everything, she said. Proudly, she showed off her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, the tiny gas stove, the neatly hanging polythene bags of medical necessities and rations. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. \nNow, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, a desolate island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space … to see things differently; to realise things I hadn’t let into my head before.’ The sight of so many abandoned whaling stations struck her as a warning. ‘It seemed as though we had just taken what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.’\nWhen I arrive at Ellen’s office she is just finishing off a heated conference call. Then she explains to me why action must be taken now to save the planet. ‘No one is making coal or oil or gas any more. They are a precious asset we have just once. We have to design a way of not using things up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but gradually I realised there was another way of looking at things.’ Now she emphasises re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.\n For the last three years, she has been touring factories, mines and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she says. ‘But I am a bit like a sponge. I love soaking things up. [The current situation] became something I just couldn’t ignore. Sailing, by comparison, seemed incredibly selfish. This is different. It’s about trying to find out how my voice can be the most useful. It really matters.’\nShe also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure that comes from being at sea,’ she says. ‘It is what makes me, me. You are so connected to everything around you. You have no time to get lonely. You are focused on the record, on practicalities, on survival. [My new] message will never be as straightforward as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest person round the world.” I may have been the fastest round the world, but this beats everything I’ve ever done.’",

    "text": "Have you ever wondered what it’s like performing in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience - a centre teaching young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes so many skills, from juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, to trapeze, which involves flying through the air above an amazed audience.  On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.\nSophia explains “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s vital to keep performances fresh and full of action. If you aim to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another brilliant side of things is friendship with other performers, and the chance to learn from them. Being fit is also really important - circus artists, like athletes, train daily to keep strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills. People often think you’re likely to suffer injuries, or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is looking ahead because you can only be on the road while you’re young and then you really need to consider other options.”\nThe course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences.  Sophia warns, however, it’s not a profession for making money!  “The work typically means not having a regular salary.  It’s also competitive - but great fun!”",

    "text": "Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed various dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a tiny boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 metres above the ground, between the two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms.\nHelen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. ‘The training was a shock’, said Helen. ‘I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped I could carry on. Every time I fell on the wire it hurt badly. But it was essential to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!’\nThe day of the actual challenge was windy and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-metre walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she admitted afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’\nThe experience has not prevented Helen, however, from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite and bike.",

    "title": "Young birdwatcher\nFifteen-year-old Jana Green writes about her hobby of birdwatching.",
    "text": "I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I’ve always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. \nMy goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that, because on family holidays abroad I’ve had the opportunity to see birds from other countries, too. We always look for places where there are group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I’d have a good chance to see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, though, as I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby.\nI posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it and commented that it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching to the school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they’d really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year!\nI’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places which have lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.",

    "title": "My life in football",
    "text": "Since I was a child, all I’ve ever wanted to do was kick a football about. I think I was programmed by my dad to some extent and he encouraged me to play. It wasn’t imposed on me, though, and I’m grateful for that. I had a friend who used to come to the park with us and his dad was really pushy. He was always saying, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My mate could have been a good player, but he just stopped wanting to play and has never been involved in football since. I’m glad it didn’t turn out that way for me, but I realise that things could have easily been so different.\nWhen I score a heart–stopping goal from a long way out, people often say that it’s just luck, but it isn’t. I have worked on taking shots at goal from a distance since I was a kid. It’s only by practising that you get to score the spectacular goals which give you such a buzz. The best players in the world, who obviously have amazing natural talent, would never have achieved what they have without years and years of practice. Sometimes you see young players crashing into each other, but I was taught technique. If I’m teaching kids, the most important thing I try to get across is to enjoy learning skills. \nI used to do every sport going at school. I’d get involved in anything, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now it’s important to get a good education, but football was the only thing on my mind then. The teachers were doing a pretty good job, but I wasn’t aware of it at the time. I don’t want it to be like that for my son. We’re already trying to read him books even though he’s far too young to sit still for long enough. I hope the fact that he usually wants to kick them around on the floor doesn’t mean that he takes after me in that way.\nAt the beginning of my professional football career, the manager made big sacrifices so that some of us younger players could move up to play for the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He never called us together and said, ‘This is your big chance to prove yourselves’ but we all knew we had to. Although I scored in the opening game of the season, we lost, and a respected TV presenter famously said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids’. That really made us aware of how much we had to do. You always have a few doubts, but we had faith in ourselves as a team despite what he said. \nI rely on close friends and family a lot. But having so much money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people sometimes say to me, ‘I can’t believe you let your mother carry on working.’ Of course I’ve helped out my parents financially. I paid off the loan on their house and I bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong individuals and I think they would be offended at the idea that they should somehow be on the payroll. My mum doesn’t earn a lot as a hairdresser but she loves what she does. On the other hand, it gives me a lot of pleasure to use my money to make things a bit easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people say, but that doesn’t give me all the answers. \nAfter I’ve stopped playing, I think I’ll have a year off or perhaps even longer, doing the things I haven’t been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg on the ski slopes and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured.",

    "text": "Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Although her parents weren’t musicians, there was always music in the house. Her grandfather played the guitar, and taught Ana and her brother to play.\nThe first time Ana tried singing in front of an audience was at school – she was so nervous that her teacher had to lead her off the stage. This teacher suggested that joining the school theatre club might make her more confident. After attending the club for a while, she happily sang with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. \nA year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them, and so she wrote her first ever song, Falling Stars. Writing it took just three days and she enjoyed it so much that she enrolled on a songwriting course run by a professional songwriter. Despite being the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of the others.  But Ana says the teacher didn’t listen to anything she said, and she wrote Something to Say about how annoyed this made her feel.\nShe posted this song online, and it became a huge success. She was delighted when people left comments saying that they loved it and found new meanings in the words each time they heard them. Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from his office on the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first she wasn’t sure; she didn’t know anything about the company, and didn’t want someone telling her what to sing. However, Joss persuaded her this wouldn’t happen, and a short time later she performed at a concert in Dublin arranged by Isotope. They sold all the tickets very quickly and it was an amazing evening.\nAna says she’s less interested in writing songs about when life’s good; when it’s not, there’s more for her to say. One of her favourite songs is Decision, written about why her brother stopped singing for a while, and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes that fans will like her songs, her aim is to write about personal experiences that matter to her.",

    "text": "My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, as his father had been before him, and I went to watch many of his games when I was a kid. You might think that seeing so many matches would give me a love of the sport, but it actually had the opposite effect. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, of course, especially when he won a game, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching.\nStarting secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager but was already two metres tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I’d be interested in training with the basketball team. Even though I enjoyed the session, I thought I’d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match, but the teacher had more confidence in me than I did. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. Mum and Dad coming to watch didn’t really help – it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end!   \nFor the next four years, I practised every day and did really well, even joining an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents. At home, I’d never been able to spend much time with my friends due to all the training, so that wasn’t such a change for me. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too!\nI turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I’d been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but had been much too light for my height, so had to get that right first. My coach already knew a team that would take me while I was still at college, so I joined them and have never regretted it.",

    "text": "It was because of Sam Carter that we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile. But now, with the hot weather, the place flowered with people.\nAnd so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity. My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind. Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\nRusty was a dog. My dog. When we first moved to Reef Point we hadn’t got a dog, so Rusty decided to remedy this. Accordingly he hung around. I chased him off and he returned, unrepentant. One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force. Rusty knew this and moved in a little nearer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us’.\nYou’re wrong Jane,’ replied my father. ‘He thinks we belong to him.’\nRusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners. He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. You’d have thought he’d have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\nWe had been swimming that day. Father, the deadline met, had driven down to Los Angeles to deliver the script in person, and Rusty and I had kept each other company in and out of the sea all afternoon. But now, the setting sun gold, it was getting cooler and we sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. They chose a wave and stood, a poem of balance, as the water curved up, riding the wave until it swept onto the sand.\nOne surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs. But now she seemed to decide to call it a day and rode in on a final wave.\nHi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’\n‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’\n‘You could get one.’\n‘No money.’\n‘You’re British, aren’t you? You visiting?’\n‘No I live here.’\n‘Is your father American?’\n‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he had written.’\n‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’\n‘Rufus Marsh.’\n‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that cover to cover’ She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. They were friendly but never interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning.",

    "title": "Teenagers and Classical Music",
    "text": "When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be pretty certain it’s not classical music they’re listening to.  Most of us can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and you can tell by the expression on their face that they haven’t a clue.  I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age.  And if you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work.\nThe statistics must be depressing for a lover of classical music.  Apparently only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere 300 copies.  I must say I still find that hard to believe.  So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries?  The older generation are irritated by our obsession with TV and video games, blaming it for most things, but I don’t think there is any connection in this case.  The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets.\nNow, I’m aware that this doesn’t apply to everyone my age.  I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts all the time, but they are a minority.  Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not exactly a classical music fan.  I enjoy a huge range of styles, but judging by what’s stored on my computer, my classical music consumption is probably pretty close to that 3% figure.\nSo why don’t teenagers like classical music?  Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its numerous changes of mood, are problematic for us.  We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast.  In addition, if you believe the experts, we have difficulty paying attention for more than about three minutes; far too short for most pieces of classical music, but perfect for a pop song.  Pop is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to, while appreciating a piece of classical music requires time and concentration.  The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics.  Classical music is incredibly powerful, but not exactly full of the issues that concern teenagers.\nThe way we listen to music has also changed.  In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and an ability to play an instrument was highly valued.  The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert.  Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.  When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing in the background?\nOne of my teachers claims that audiences at classical concerts have actually increased in recent years.  Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers.  In my orchestra we play classical music in all sorts of different places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see virtually nothing but grey hair when I look into the crowd.  I don’t know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your mum and dad love something, the chances are you’ll do your best to stay away from it.\nSome say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra.  They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse.  Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice.  The two activities have become separated.  When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.",

    "text": "In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take it in turns to race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 metres high, negotiating sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops on the way, all at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part.\nAn hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets, because tiny objects can become very dangerous during the flight. I also learnt that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout. ‘The horizon is your best friend,’ I was told, ‘the pilot will explain in which direction you have to look.’ I was also asked to promise that when I was flying upside down, I would ‘completely relax. Try and enjoy the view.’ Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not, under any circumstances, to touch anything.\nBy the time we were taxiing down the runway, my legs up in front of me, feet trying not to touch the incredibly important steering pedals, hands trying not to rest on any of the many important switches within reach, my mind had made itself up. Ignoring all instructions received, I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. None of this was of particular comfort as we began accelerating down the runway.\nDario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. There we were in the Zivko Edge 540, upsettingly one of the world’s fastest acrobatic planes, ready to go. The plane took off and two seconds later we banked sharply to the right. It was an instant, violent manoeuvre and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked up at the horizon, tensed everything and emitted short gasps as I sank down into the seat. For a split second I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. And then we levelled out. We turned another sharp left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 metres and my lungs scrunched up on the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 metres off the ground, aiming for the alarmingly small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour but my whoop of momentary excitement was stolen by a sharp right turn. We hadn’t even done any acrobatics yet.\nFor two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, my hand shaking so much the plane shook too… it’s that responsive. And then after that Dario said something. And I said, ‘Can you repeat that?’ But instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full lateral 360o turn.\n‘Are you okay?’\n‘Yup.’\n‘Have you had enough?’\n‘No,’ I lied.\nThen he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, turning a full circle in the air. Now, I am aware that many people would find this exciting. The sort of people who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I just thought it was a bit much. At the top of the loop, as we were flying upside down, I heard small voice shouting, ‘Relax, relax, look up.’ Then I looked up and saw some fields.\nThe flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been ‘soft’ compared to what the pilots endure when they race. As if to illustrate the point, Dario got out some sandwiches the minute we landed and merrily tucked in. I didn’t eat for hours and that night I did the loop the loop over and over again in my sleep.",

    "title": "Learning freestyle ski jumping\nby Harry Dean",
    "text": "‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The assembled group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who’d had some experience of freestyle ski-jumping, and presumably wanted to preserve his reputation as someone who knew exactly what he was doing, soon pushed forward, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Even to our untutored eyes, something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth then kindly informed us, ‘speed is an unpredictable beast.’\nPerhaps I just wasn’t cut out for this freestyle stuff. On previous skiing holidays, I’d enjoyed messing about, practising turns in the snow. I just wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. Deep down, I'd always thought it looked fun, but reckoned that, with my lack of know-how, if I’d tried to join with the skateboarders, with their baggy trousers and special language, I’d have risked total ridicule.\nThen my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, from which students leapt, shrieking attempted their new tricks, then landed in pits of foam cubes –  hardly a realistic introduction to what lay ahead of us out on the slopes. After practising their moves indoors, students headed outside to try them for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan cheerily assured us. ‘Before places like this trained people up, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’\nThe ‘knuckle’ Gareth was referring to is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again to become the landing zone proper.  Land in the zone and your motion continues forward, minimising impact. Land on the flat and you stop dead, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, though, it was all but impossible to convince my body to ignore what my brain was screaming at me and to race straight towards the jump. My legs would virtually go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came slamming down onto the knuckle. I managed not to fall but by midday I felt several centimetres shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. \nDay two started on the trampolines in the centre. I'd expected to hate being stuck indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some of the drills copied moves we’d make while ski-jumping, others were aimed at teaching ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in space. Gareth gave us a running commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ apparently needed work – and it’s true that, every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and nothing more until I found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.\nWe moved back to the mountain to try again. Inevitably, there were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as delighted as me, and for a few moments I was walking on air, with the sheer pride of having achieved such an elusive goal. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to reduce speed as I approached the jump, became airborne,  and came down appropriately in the landing zone. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet.",

    "text": "‘What on earth have I done?’ Violet Hetherington asked herself.\nShe was standing in one of several queues in the dock at Southampton. The queues, by now spilling out of the cattle shed marked ‘Departures’, to board the Queen Caroline where long and none was moving. ‘It’s best to get to the docks late’, her friend Annie had advised. ‘If you get there too early you can grow roots hanging about.’ Annie, married to a diplomat and full of advice, was a seasoned traveller. But on this occasion her advice was mistaken.\nAfter a while an announcement came through the loudspeakers: there had been a ‘breakdown in the computer system.’ In the face of this setback the atmosphere among the waiting passengers darkened. Some attempted patience, some brave souls even tried to rise to jollity but for the most part the mood became rebellious. They had paid good money – through the nose, many were inclined to feel – for this voyage. This might be their last chance for a bit of luxury. That they could not even be got aboard efficiently did not promise well.\nViolet’s own instinct was to turn tail. She felt in her bag for her phone and discovered that it was missing. This was a good deal more annoying than the length of the queues. It confirmed an uneasy sense that the whole idea of a cruise was one of her mistakes. And now there was the nuisance of the phone. She couldn’t ring the minicab company to check whether she had left it in the taxi, because that number – along with all her other numbers – was stored in her phone. The very error that her elder son Harry was always  counselling her to avoid.\nBehind her in the queue, stood an approachable-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry but, stupidly, I seem to have left my mobile phone behind. I couldn’t borrow yours to make one call, could I?’ Violet rang Harry on the obliging couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbour, if she would check to see whether the phone had been left behind. It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them. Dan might easily forget to give the message to Kristina at all.\nEventually the queues started to move forward and Violet was ushered towards a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to go aboard. Her heart sank further in the ship’s foyer which resembled one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high. There were panels of shining fake walnut, extravagant cascades of chandeliers, polished brass plating and carpets patterned in the style commonly found at airports.\nViolet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’ which were lined floor to ceiling with mirrors and crammed with passengers who, bedraggled from early morning starts, luggage disposal and the incurable anxiety induced by travel arrangements, might have preferred to be spared the sight of their multiple reflections. Violet was squashed against the side of the lift as it moved upward, stopping at each floor to release a tide of thankful prisoners. But, at last, at the twelfth floor, she stepped out to freedom.\nAnd, thank heavens, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been anxiously rehearsing what to say if it had not. Ignoring Annie’s suggestion that she wait for a last minute deal, she had thrown caution to the winds and paid the highest price she could afford in order to be sure of the sea.",

    "title": "Howard’s Career as a Palaeontologist",
    "text": "Howard became a palaeontologist because of a rise in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, a cautious man with a large mortgage and thoughts focussed merely on how the economic situation would affect him, announced that the projected holiday to Spain was no longer feasible. A chalet was rented on the English coast instead and thus, on a dank August afternoon, Howard picked up an ammonite* on the beach.\nHe knew for a long time that he wanted to become a palaeontologist, and towards the end of his time at university he became clear as to what sort of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He found the focus of his interest reaching further and further back in time. The more spectacular areas were not for him, he realised, turning his back on the Jurassic, on dinosaurs. He was drawn particularly to the beginnings, to that ultimate antiquity where everything is decided, whence, against all odds, we derive. So he studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks.\nWork on his doctoral thesis came to an end, and, he knew, possibly a bitter one. Would he get a job? Would he get a job in the sort of institution he sought? He was far from being without self-esteem and knew that his potential was good. But he knew that those who deserve do not always get, and that while the objectives of science may be pure and uncompromising, the process of appointment to an academic position is not. When the Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London came up, he applied at once, though without high hopes. \nOn the morning of Howard’s interview, the professor who would chair the panel had a row with his wife. As a consequence he left home in a state of irritation and inattention, drove his car violently into a gatepost and ended up in the Casualty Department of the local hospital. The interview took place without him and without the support he had intended to give to the candidate who had been a student of his. \nThe professor who replaced him on the panel was a hated colleague, whose main concern was to oppose the appointment of his enemy’s protégé; he was able to engineer without much difficulty that Howard got the job. Howard, surprised at the evident favouritism from a man he did not know, was fervently grateful until, months later, a colleague kindly enlightened him as to the correct interpretation of events. Howard was only slightly chagrined. It would have been nice to think that he was the obvious candidate, or that he had captivated those present with his ability and personality. But by then the only thing that really mattered was that he had the job and that he could support himself by doing the sort of work he wanted to do.\nHe often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life – where the pursuit of scientific truth was concerned, it was possible to plan a course of action and carry it out – with the anarchy of private concerns. The world teems with people who can determine the quality of your existence, and on occasion some total stranger can reach in and manipulate the entire narrative, as Howard was to find when his briefcase, containing the notes for a lecture he was about to give, was stolen at an Underground station. \nFuming, Howard returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learnt of the recently acquired collection of fossils, as yet uncatalogued and unidentified, the study of which would provide him with his greatest challenge and ensure his professional future. But for the theft, but for that now benevolent stranger ... Within half an hour he had dismantled and reassembled his plans. He would not go to a conference in Stockholm. He would not spend a fortnight taking students on a field trip to Scotland. He would pull out every stop and somehow scramble together the funds for a visit to the museum in Nairobi. ",

    "text": "In 2006 Jeff Somers began a journey round the world on a penny farthing, an old-fashioned bicycle, with one big and one small wheel.  He had already written a book about his experiences travelling round Canada in a 50-year-old car and was mad about motor sport and had a job building racing car engines. To save money Jeff rode to work on an old bicycle, which he also used to go to Amsterdam on holiday. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’\nJeff didn’t want a normal touring bike and he knew he wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’  After two false starts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to turn back because of a knee injury, he finally set out in 2006. He was away for three years, having travelled through 23 countries on four continents.\nThe best bit of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment came when he had to drink some dirty water from a stream. A serious fever left him in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for either hospital bills or the journey home. Yet despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it I would set off travelling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’",

    "text": "If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily, the midnight world as visible to us as it is to the vast number of nocturnal species on this planet who feel at home in it. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. This basic fact is engrained deep in our genetic make-up, even though most of us don’t think of ourselves as diurnal beings any more than we think of ourselves as primates or mammals or Earthlings. Yet it’s the only way to explain what we’ve done to the night…\nWe’ve somehow managed to engineer the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Its benefits come with consequences – called light pollution – whose effects scientists are only now beginning to study. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into the sky, where it’s not wanted, instead of focusing it downward, where it is. Ill-designed lighting washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted. Wherever man-made light spills into the natural world, some aspects of life – migration, reproduction, feeding – is affected.\nFor most human history, the phrase ‘light pollution’ would have made no sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was Earth’s most populous city. Nearly a million people lived there, making do, as they always had, with candles, torches and lanterns. Only a few houses were lit by gas, and there would be no public gaslights in the streets or squares for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its dim collective glow.\nWe’ve lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country, when nothing could be further from the truth. Among mammals alone, the number of nocturnal species is astonishing. Light is a powerful biological force, and on many species it acts as a magnet attracting them to it. The effect is so powerful that scientists speak of songbirds and seabirds being ‘captured’ by searchlights on land or by the light from gas flares on marine oil platforms, circling and circling in the thousands until they drop. Migrating at night, birds are apt to collide with brightly lit tall buildings; immature birds on their first journey suffer disproportionately. Some birds – blackbirds and nightingales, among others – sing at unnatural hours in the presence of artificial light.\nIt was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need to see the night sky in all its glorious clarity. Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need an undiminished view of the night sky for our work, but like most other creatures we do need darkness. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself; the price of \nmodifying our internal clockwork means it doesn’t operate as it should, causing various physical ailments. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.\nIn the end, humans are no less trapped by light pollution than the frogs in a pond near a brightly lit highway. Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way – the edge of our galaxy – arching overhead.",

    "title": "A musician and his pupil\nPaul Williams interviews the famous pianist Alfred Brendel",
    "text": "Over six decades the pianist Alfred Brendel gradually built up and maintained a dominant position in the world of classical music. He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn’t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14. He listened to him play. Brendel explained, ‘He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note. It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing. One doesn’t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection’.\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains ‘When I was very young, I didn’t have the urge to be famous in five year’s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on. Although I do not have the physical power now, in my head, there are always things going on, all sorts of pieces that I’ve never played. I don’t play now but it’s a very nice new career.’",

    "title": "A special astronomy club \nA group of US teenagers study the night sky.",
    "text": "The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US surrounded almost entirely by wilderness, to the east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Over the last few years, this isolated group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, around 35 km above the Earth's surface. It's a long-running science project but with a bit of a twist: it’s part astronomy experiment, part backcountry adventure, which is possibly why teenagers get involved. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or piece of metal travelling through space enters the earth's atmosphere, producing a trail of light.\nAs it gets dark, the teenagers secure a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude and a thermometer to gauge the changes along the ascent. Two GPS trackers are mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group to find it later. A gas tank, donated by an enthusiast in a neighbouring state, is used to inflate the balloon, which slowly grows to the size of a small car. An older boy had made a seven-hour round trip to get hold of it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. Anyway, for kids in this club, that’s a given.\nFinally, it's time for lift-off.  ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon begins its ascent. Some of them run and track its path with powerful flashlights for as long as they are able, illuminating the creamy orb in the moonless sky. There is quiet, and a palpable sense of collective wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night.\nWhen the launch is over, most of the students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside and gaze at a sky so breathtakingly clear, it's hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles, a crowded and bustling metropolis of around 4 million people.\nI watch a boy climb into a sleeping bag and promptly fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ says one girl in hushed tones. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor shoots across the middle of the sky.\nAs a balloon rises, the air pressure lessens and the balloon expands until it's almost the size of a house. Then it pops in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the following day, using the GPS trackers as a guide. Getting it back isn’t straightforward, but that’s part of the appeal. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box almost always lands somewhere in the middle of nowhere. ‘To me, recoveries are a huge part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey has been becoming more familiar with this landscape in a way you never normally would.’\nOn this occasion, the lunch box had landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get to it, the recovery team would have to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountain range. Then they'd have to agree whether driving or walking would be preferable – things could turn treacherous if the lunch box was on a high peak, or even worse, up a very tall tree. ‘It's important to keep in mind that these students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What may seem wild and perilous to some, is simply a way of life to others.’ \nIn the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges. And it's also one more tale of adventure to share with anyone who asks.",

    "text": "At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do.  Nearly all the children know how to swim and play table-tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them.  Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end.  This makes them feel great.\nWe do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week.  It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds.  We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time.  First we tell them they can phone home after lunch.  Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow.  Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.\nIt's not always the children who feel lonely.  We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is getting on, which is quite unnecessary.  Often their son or daughter will be busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to ring back another time.\nWe often get a certain type of child coming, typically dressed in expensive  new clothes.  Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but before long they understand the reason why. ",

    "text": "I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence.  The 15-year-old Australian has already released a number of very successful songs.  So how did a laid-back surfer guy end up on a stage in front of thousands and thousands of fans?  ‘I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,’ Cody says, recalling how it all began. `But you know I was swimming every day, and I was surfing. Those were the things that meant more to me back then; I had my life set up and so much to occupy my time.  I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online.’  These videos changed everything.  He began with a posting of a friend and himself singing at a school concert. Fans sent in online comments saying they wanted more of his videos to appear on their social networking sights. So Cody, who’d recorded some more at home, was happy to oblige. The responses to them were overwhelming.\nCody was a very talented swimmer.  He was training hard with some of the best coaches and putting his focus into perfecting his sport.  But then record labels came calling, and he had a tough choice to make: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a huge risk by signing a deal and moving with his entire family to the US. Cody resolved to take the plunge.  ‘It was very difficult for me – especially at such a young age – to have to choose a career for myself.  Can you imagine, at 12 or 13 years old trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?’\nHe had to break the news to his swimming coach – as well as to his friends – that he was moving to the States.  ‘It came as a big surprise to most people.  I’m kind of the quiet kid,’ he says, remembering their shocked expressions after hearing the news.  ‘I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy work.’  So Cody packed his bags and went with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream in the hope of making another one come true.  And although his family keep out of the spotlight and aren’t directly involved in his career, they are there in the background.  Cody says it’s important to keep that tight circle of great people around you to make sure that your feet are always attached to the ground.\nOf course, we all have days of doubt.  ‘Sometimes when I’m left alone for a while I sit and think, “How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?”  My little brother’s eight years old, and he’s travelling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,’ Cody admits.  ‘I worry about the effect of that on him sometimes, but my family’s always reassuring me that they’re here to support me and encourage me in everything that I do.’\nSuccess, in whatever career you choose, comes from a willingness to say ‘yes’ to your big break, even when it’s a little scary to do so.  ‘It all just happened so fast and unexpectedly,’ Cody says.  ‘Now, to be going to countries I never thought I’d visit in my life, and to be playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like something that I think lots of people dream of and try to achieve.  But I know it won’t last forever.’",

    "title": "Short Stories",
    "text": "To put it in the simplest possible terms, I find writing novels a challenge, writing short stories a joy.  If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.  The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.  The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves, which are sometimes dyed a brilliant gold.  Meanwhile, in the garden, buds appear on flowers, and colourful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the subtle transition from one season to the next.\nSince the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories.  My pattern has been this: once I finish a novel, I find I want to write some short stories; once a group of short stories is done, then I feel like focusing on a novel.  I never write any short stories while I’m writing a novel, and never write a novel while I’m working on short stories.  The two types of writing may very well engage different parts of the brain, and it takes some time to get off one track and switch to the other.\nIt was only after I began my career with two short novels in 1975 that I started, from 1984 to 1985, to write short stories.  I knew little about short-story writing then so it was rough going, but I did find the experience really memorable.  I felt the possibilities of my fictional world expand by several degrees.  And readers seemed to appreciate this other side of me as a writer.  One of my earliest works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.  This was my starting point as a short-story writer.\nOne of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take so long to finish.  Generally it takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape (though revisions can be endless).  It’s not like the total physical and mental commitment you have to make for the year or two it takes to compose a novel.  You go into a room, finish your work, and leave.  That’s it.  For me, at least, writing a novel can seem to drag on for ever, and I sometimes wonder if I’m going to survive.  So I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace.\nOne more nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story out of the smallest things – an idea that springs up in your mind, a word, an image, whatever.  In most cases it’s like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to.  And another good point is that with short stories you don’t have to worry about failing.  If the idea doesn’t work out the way you hoped it would, you just shrug your shoulders and tell yourself that they can’t all be winners.  Even with masters of the genre like the American writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver, not every short story is a masterpiece.  I find this a great comfort.  You can learn from your mistakes (in other words, those you cannot call a complete success) and use that in the next story you write.  In my case, when I write novels I try very hard to learn from the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories.  In that sense the short story is a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist.  It is hard to experiment the way I like to do inside the framework of a novel, so without short stories I know I would find the task of writing novels even more difficult and demanding.\nMy short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind.  I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did.  Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.",

    "title": "Working with Huskies",
    "text": "Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in the far north of Finland. At 26, I was restless. I was dreaming of Arctic landscapes, cold and bleak expanses, perhaps in reaction to the noise and crowded living of London. So I found a small company run by Anna McCormack, and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, deep in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow (for anything from an hour to a five-day stretch). They started with six dogs, which rapidly expanded to more than 100.\nRecently, they took over a second property – the 'wilderness farm’, which they wrote was a picturesque but basic outpost with untrustworthy electrics and no running water. I could join the team for three months, they told me, if I knew what I was letting myself in for. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough and the work very physical.’ I started packing straight away.\nNovember 6, London\nOn my flight out I find myself staring blankly at a page of more than 100 shots of huskies; I am meant to have memorised their names by the time I get there, but I am distracted and panicky. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. It is said that spring marches north at a rate of about 26 km per day, a tidal wave of opening flowers and leaves. I think what I am seeing, however, is the opposite movement, with winter marching south, and the rivers freezing over. \nNovember 7, Helsinki and Hetta\nThe bus north is everything I was hoping for. We drive through endless dark forest – thin conifers, weighed down by snow – stopping occasionally to let reindeer lumber out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark, and am barely through the door when I’m handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question.\nI follow the sound of barking, which grows to a wall of noise by the time I reach the dogsheds. Three figures are running back and forth up the lines of huskies, pulling them out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too harried to stop and talk much anyway. I hover on the sidelines and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command rings out, and with a jerk we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.\nNovember 15, Hetta\nIt does not take long to be initiated into the ranks of the husky guides, but not before a demoralising quizzing on what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m stumped. I don’t know. Am I? Further questioning reveals that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved.\nThe basics of dog-sledding can be picked up very quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems to be very complicated. Simple tasks such as feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in sub-zero conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week my head is spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around myself by overenthusiastic huskies. But I am triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’",

    "text": "I was born in Denver, USA and started snowboarding aged eight when my Dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked unbelievably steep so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. Because I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too – he made it look so simple. And in the end, I managed just fine. \nAfter this experience, it wasn’t long before I’d developed a love of the sport and had improved my ability too. I started competing aged ten. Some people enter loads of competitions, and end up getting bored of snowboarding, but my love of taking part, and winning too, if I’m honest, has got stronger as I’ve got older, which always helps me to push myself harder. I enjoy not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this goes well, like when I became the first female ever to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d even attempt the jumps that got me this score until I actually set off. That achievement increased my trust in my own abilities.\nDuring the summer, I focus on training and my studies while there’s no snow. Although I train daily, it’s nice not having to stick to quite a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also get to spend lots of time with my friends then. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much and what I’m really good at. \nI have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m wondering whether becoming a doctor is a possibility, if my active life allows time for doing a college degree. It’s impossible to imagine myself growing tired of the sport, but I can’t go on snowboarding my whole life.",

    "text": "When I was fifteen, I just wanted everything my friends had, and I never planned ahead – for example, I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday and, of course, I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson.\nI worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it, so my parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I’d seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could have a go at that. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy, as it had seemed so complicated when I’d watched Mum doing it. My friends thought it sounded dull, but I was really into the idea. Mum had shown me it was possible to create something attractive at home using basic tools and materials.\nI sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I’d finished making them. They told me they were delighted with them, of course, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So although I was grateful they’d bought them, I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public.\nThere was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. They thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall! That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website.\nSince then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, although we still have our stall too. It’s been such a lot of fun so far.",

    "title": "Why do we dream?",
    "text": "There’s been a lot of talk about sleep lately. When I wrote the book Insomniac, about people who suffer from sleeplessness, I felt like a lone voice warning of the dangers of sleep-deprivation, and the impact sleep loss has on our minds, bodies, and moods. As any insomniac will tell you (and I interviewed dozens), there’s nothing so crucial as sleep for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems those who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. So it’s great that sleep is getting this long overdue attention. But I’m wondering, what about dreams? I haven’t heard much about dreams in the discussion.\nWe’re losing dreams all the time. When you wake to an early alarm, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, the sleep you sacrifice is mainly REM or ‘Rapid Eye Movement’, the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Our most vivid, memorable and emotionally powerful dreams occur mainly in the stage of REM just before we wake up in the morning. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of sleep time in REM, so a person who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers deprive people of REM, there is an increase in amount and intensity of REM to compensate the following night. So it seems dreams are there for something.\nWhen researchers discovered REM in 1953, most agreed with the great psychologist Sigmund Freud, who had argued that interpreting dreams was the best way of understanding the way our mind works. It didn’t turn out to be that simple, of course. Subsequent findings about the workings of the brain did not support this belief. The focus of dream study shifted to the physical rather than psychological origins of dreams. At present, there is ‘precious little on which dream researchers agree,’ says Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold.\nDreams are important. At an annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel of the University of Colorado Medical School described a study that found a much better ability to remember and use dreams among actors, writers, and directors than among participants at his sleep center. Dream use increases, he concludes, in proportion to a person’s interest in the creative process. It makes sense that filmmakers have an important relationship with their dreams, since film is, of all human creations, probably the most dream-like. But I came away from Pagel’s talk thinking, are artistic types the only ones who have a use for their dreams? Doesn’t everybody – teachers and software designers and politicians – need to think creatively?\nDreams, Stickgold says, are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways, drawing on stores of knowledge from the past and present to find new associations. Dreams may help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking. For example, Stickgold has found that when people are awakened out of REM and asked to say what comes to their minds in response to a certain word, their responses are more original than when awoken from other stages of sleep. They ‘ignore the obvious and put together things that make a kind of crazy unexpected kind of sense ... This is what creativity is,’ says Stickgold.\nI certainly write better when I awake out of intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to provide some kind of fluency, fuel for thought. Those are the days that the words and images tumble out so fast that my fingers on the keys can barely keep up. I don’t know how it works, but it does seem to work. But creativity isn’t just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. All of us need our brains to be functioning fully. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we negotiate relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, friends. This is why we need to dream.",

    "title": "Television director John Henderson talks about filming  ‘The Borrowers’ TV series.",
    "text": "The novel ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house, secretly ‘borrowing’ things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I realised it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. Those who love the book have very definite ideas about how everything should be. I relied heavily on the original drawings from the book because I didn't want to be chased down the street by people telling me I'd got it all wrong. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex. \nThe most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we were filming the Borrowers nervously walking across a room or bravely setting out on one of their borrowing missions, we had to be 10 times further away than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres, in order to get the Borrowers' perspective; they got through so many pairs of jeans between them! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right when the images of the supposedly tiny Borrowers were combined with a background image of ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called and asked how I'd done it.\nThe only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards of the house, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry around things such as a giant pair of scissors, they really entered into the spirit of \t\tit. I particularly remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and difficult to lift. We’d often have to stop shooting because they made the crew laugh so much. But in the story there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with the hoses and said the experience was so frightening, they didn’t have to act at all. \nOne of the things that was important to me, and which directors have struggled with in other TV versions, was getting the costumes right. I had them made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. This made it nearly impossible for the leading actress to bend in her costume.  She couldn’t sit down during breaks in filming, and she couldn’t even take the dress off as she had to be sewn into it every morning. The trousers worn by the lead actor were made from a rug, as normal trouser material would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think either of them thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!\nMost of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren't physically there. I had to draw pictures of every scene myself to show people how each one should look – I’d done 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t accurate in any way, but they worked well enough. The budget wouldn’t stretch to having time in special effects studios during the day, so I spent three months working nights.  We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realising there was no film in the camera.  But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in conveying the magic of the books.",

    "title": "A great painter who copies",
    "text": "It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. But as you walk into her studio with its incredible sea view, you pass a number of empty frames hanging on the walls, between smiling photographs of her two daughters. For a pioneer of the copyist art movement, able to reproduce the richness of an early-20th century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait, it seems a strange oversight.\n‘I don’t have any of my own knocking around,’ says Susie with a shrug. ‘As soon as I finish them, they go.’ The problem is that Susie’s in great demand. During her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted the works of numerous great artists: Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh among them. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals. While the originals would fetch millions of pounds in auctions, her reproductions fetch anything between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, as determined by how long she spends on them.\nSusie won’t name most of her clients, even when pushed, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors are genuine art lovers, status is often a factor. One celebrity buyer loves to boast about his ‘Van Gogh’ painting, when it’s really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. ‘Actually, many famous people pass off my copies as originals,’ she says. ‘That’s up to them.’ Some collectors save on house insurance by storing the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie’s copy.\nSusie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible – she believes doing it badly would be letting the artist down. But she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as the real thing is against the law, and although she knows people who have made money that way, it’s why she has never been tempted. The makers of fakes tend to end up in trouble, one way or another. She points out that she isn’t rich and has struggled at times. However, her situation is more secure now and it wouldn’t make sense to put her reputation among collectors and artists at risk.\nSusie hasn’t always been a copyist. After her art degree, she was hired as an illustrator by a botanical garden. For several years she worked for a pittance. Looking back she can see it was good grounding for what she does now, and it gave her a passion for plants, although it was barely enough to survive on. She tells me she had to be incredibly accurate, and that it was important to get things right first time. She has no regrets about having done it, but she’s glad she eventually found something more rewarding financially.\nWhen younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does. Her approach has equipped her to do anything from drawing plants to making perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art, though she now specialises in the French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne and Degas her favourites. Susie also says there’s an assumption that more modern art is straightforward – kid’s stuff almost. The impressionists, for instance, painted quickly and freely. In Susie’s experience, what people fail to realise is the impressionists were also meticulous, and that combination is tougher than anything else to get right.\nGiven her skills, it seems odd that Susie doesn’t do her own stuff. Isn’t art about expressing yourself? And might a Susie Ray original earn more than a Susie Ray copy? She says what she does is the result of years of training and application – and she makes a good living from it. She has occasionally tried her own thing. She once attempted oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up just looking like photographs – OK, but no better than that. Perhaps it’s like surviving on bread and water after a lifetime of food cooked by a top chef. The thing about Susie is she’s a perfectionist.",

    "title": "Critical Thinking\nWe examine whether people are still able to engage in critical thinking in modern day society",
    "text": "Critical, or analytical, thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in attempt to have a deeper understanding. ‘There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth,’ observes Adrian West, research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., and a former computer science lecturer at the University of Manchester. \nAlthough there’s little debate that information technology complements – and often enhances – the human mind in the quest to store information and process an ever-growing tangle of bits and bytes, there’s increasing concern that the same technology is changing the way we approach complex problems, and making it more difficult to really think. ‘We’re exposed to greater amounts of poor yet charismatic thinking, the fads of intellectual fashion, opinion, and mere assertion,’ says West. ‘The wealth of communications and information can easily overwhelm our reasoning abilities.’ What’s more, it’s ironic that ever-growing piles of data and information do not equate to greater knowledge and better decision-making. What’s remarkable, West says, is just ‘how little this has affected the quality of our thinking.’\nAccording to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading, for one thing, has declined 10 percentage points, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Many, including Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles, believe that a greater focus on visual media comes at a price. ‘A drop-off in reading has possibly contributed to a decline in critical thinking,’ she says. ‘There is a greater emphasis on real-time media and multi-tasking rather than focusing on a single thing.’ Nevertheless, a definitive answer about how technology affects critical thinking is not yet available. Instead, due to the ever greater presence of technology, critical thinking has landed in a mushy swamp, and academics can no longer rely on fundamental beliefs that they previously held.\nWhile it’s tempting to view computers, video games, and the internet in a largely good or bad way, the reality is that they may be both, and different technologies, systems, and uses yield entirely different results. For example, a computer game may promote critical thinking or detract from it. Reading on the internet may ratchet up one’s ability to analyze while chasing an endless array of hyperlinks may undercut deeper thought.\nExposure to technology fundamentally changes the way people think, says Greenfield, who recently analyzed more than 50 studies on learning and technology. As visual media have exploded, noticeable changes have resulted, she notes. ‘Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not,’ Greenfield explains. ‘It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary.’ However, she has found that visual media actually improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, ‘most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination,’ she says. The upshot? Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities.\nHow society views technology has a great deal to do with how it forms perceptions about critical thinking. And nowhere is the conflict more apparent than at the intersection of video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, points out that things aren’t always as they appear. ‘There is a strong undercurrent of opinion that video and computer games aren’t healthy for kids,’ he says. ‘The reality is that they are not only a major form of entertainment, they often provide a very good tool for learning.’ In fact, an expanding body of evidence indicates that joysticks can go a long way toward building smarter children with better reasoning skills. Games such as Sim City and Civilization extend beyond rote memorization, and teach decision-making and analytical skills in immersive, virtual environments that resemble the real world, Gee says. Moreover, these games – and some virtual worlds – give participants freedom to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.\nIt’s certain that in the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it’s time to take a closer look at technology and understand the subtleties of how it affects thinking and analysis.",

    "title": "Janine Stuart, young writer",
    "text": "When Janine Stuart was only 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which went on to become a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview about her book, Janine said, ‘Because of my father’s job, my family’s moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book focus on Amelia’s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother. As I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.’\nJanine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.\nOne review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges, and this is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best selling authors.\nJanine’s still getting used to being a famous writer: ‘At first, I hid when people recognised me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is hang out with my friends for a while, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!’",

    "title": "Are humans and animals really so different?\nScience correspondent Martha Hamlin looks at whether anthropomorphism – attributing human characteristics or behavior to animals – is necessarily a bad thing",
    "text": "One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky hauled himself out of his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium, heaved himself across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story fit for a children’s film, and was widely shared online. Part of the fun of the story and other such tales of escape, involving creatures as diverse as rats and llamas, is indulging in a bit of knowing anthropomorphism: animals, they’re just like us! In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced, because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own. How is it that eight-tentacled sea creatures can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as portable armor and even exhibit sophisticated play behavior?\nAnthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that it is not in fact anthropomorphising, but its opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals, or what he terms anthropodenial – that has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Analysing decades of animal-cognition research, he shows that, with the exception of fully-developed language, animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals: the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. Animals, in other words, are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.\nAnthropodenial, in de Waal’s opinion, is a relatively modern phenomenon. In medieval and early modern Europe, the animal mind was considered sophisticated enough that animals could be put on trial for crimes. And as recently as the nineteenth century, many naturalists sought out the connections between human and animal intelligence. ‘The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind,’ one nineteenth-century naturalist wrote. And this was no radical supporter of animal rights; it was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution changed the way we understand our place in the world.\nThe advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on conditioning animals through reward and punishment, shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, the two dominant schools of thought viewed animals as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Anyone who thought about animals having internal lives was dismissed as romantic, or unscientific. It is perhaps no accident that this shift occurred during the same century that saw humans tearing down animal habitats at unprecedented rates, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock which ignored the welfare of the animals.\nHappily, de Waal believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. ‘The times are changing,’ he writes. ‘Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last few decades, diffused over the internet.’ The most effective tests of animal intelligence, he argues, are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but whereas we need apps to find our misplaced phones, they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery points out that if an octopus were to measure human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us fail the test, it might conclude that we are pretty stupid.\nDe Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to a drain leading to the ocean.  But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. When the monkeys were rewarded with either cucumbers (a well-liked monkey food) or grapes (an even better one), those given cucumbers shrieked and raged at seeing their peers get the superior treat. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later. Just one of the oddities of our particular kind of animal mind.",

    "text": "Whenever I tell people what I do for a living, they can hardly believe this job exists. But I’m not joking! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting the chocolate is an essential part of making sure that customers get perfect bars of high-quality chocolate from the company I work for.\nEvery week I receive samples, small amounts that show what the chocolate is like, from our factory and I have to check them for taste, texture and smell. I also have to taste the raw materials we usually use – the nuts, fruit and so on. I spend days choosing the most suitable ones to go into the chocolate. \nJust beside my company office I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make – and I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to play with. It’s wonderful to have a private space I can go off to during the day. \nNo two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab and others I’m out of the country buying our raw materials and, as I’ve got a young family, that can be difficult. But that kind of variety, and lack of routine, is something I love about the job, although I think it still comes second to the chocolate itself! The question I get asked most is whether I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt I didn’t want to eat it. In fact, I’ll often go home and eat some more in the evening!",

    "title": "The daily routines of great people",
    "text": "Nearly every weekday morning for a year and a half, I got up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past four hundred years approached this exact same task – that is, how they made the time each day to do their best work, how they organized their schedules in order to be creative and productive. By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives – when they slept and ate and worked and worried – I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,’ the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote. I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.’\nIn that sense, this is a superficial book. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. (The novelist John Cheever thought that you couldn’t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self – isn’t that the truth?) My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me? \nI don’t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages – probably some of them can’t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises – but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \nThe book’s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people’s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot. But in the right hands, your daily routine can be a finely calibrated mechanism for taking advantage of a range of limited resources: time (the most limited resource of all) as well as willpower and optimism. A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. The psychologist William James thought you wanted to put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a chronic procrastinator and could never stick to a regular schedule. \nAs it happens, it was an inspired bout of procrastination that led to the creation of this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I’m a classic ‘morning person’, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers’ working schedules. These were easy to find and highly entertaining. It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place – hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people’s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I’ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. In other cases, I have cobbled together a summary of their routines from secondary sources. I should note here that this book would have been impossible without the research of the hundreds of biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I drew upon. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading.",

    "title": "Shirley Ford, voiceover artist\nClive Gartside meets the voiceover artist Shirley Ford, whose voice is familiar from advertisements, cartoons and other recordings.\n",
    "text": "During our first, hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me in the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, an amusing elderly Scottish woman and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices – I struggled to keep count of them all – are recognisable to viewers of children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to learn quickly how to pronounce loads of medical terms.’\nShirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Lots of actors, some very highly regarded, reckon they can do funny voices and, actually, many of them probably can,’ she says. ‘There’s more to it than that, though. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many household names are desperate to do voiceover work. Thinking of the publicity, producers will invite them to auditions, but often they don’t get offered parts because they’re too used to acting with their whole bodies.’\nAfter school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course with a standard acting career in mind. During the course, she had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. It seemed ridiculous – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for a laugh and, amazingly, ended up getting a major part.’ Shirley realised she could do voices and that voiceover work might be the way to go. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky enough to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’\nAdult female actors are frequently asked to provide the voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than those of male actors, and in the recruitment of child performers there are complex procedures and endless forms to deal with, which production companies on tight schedules would rather avoid. Shirley has learnt to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices as she watches children’s TV.\nCartoons are the highlight of a job that includes a whole range of things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound enthusiastic about something you care nothing about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheery. When I've got some days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; the interaction with other actors makes a huge difference.’ \nThe competition for work is fierce, and a good showreel – a recording demonstrating what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies which specialise in helping voiceover artists put them together.’ She claims to have got where she is – near the top of her profession – through doggedness as much as natural ability. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it round all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies and recording studios, or simply practising your voices, it’s all about setting goals and refusing to give up.’ \nFor anyone considering a career doing voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is fundamental, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a sense, becoming the characters she is performing. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take control of me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, perhaps even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’",

    "text": "Mum caught Jess by the arm.  ‘Come with me,’ she said.  Jess followed her through to the study and there on the table, propped against the wall, was an unframed painting, unmistakably one of Grandpa’s, yet unlike anything he had done before, and clearly nowhere near finished.  ‘Do you know anything about this?’ said Mum.  Jess shook her head.  ‘I’ve never seen it before.  I didn’t know he was working on anything.’\nJess stared at the picture.  There was a river that dominated the scene; not a river she recognized and perhaps not even a real one at all, just a fantasy river.  The picture was strange and amorphous – and beautiful in an eerie way.  The riverbank was almost insignificant, such a subtle hint of green that the eye barely took it in, being somehow drawn into the pale waters and away towards a hidden sea.  There were no animals, no birds, no people; and it felt right that way.  There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision.  Yet for some reason, she was captivated, thinking of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer.\nMum spoke again.  ‘It’s got a name.’  There was something in her voice – something too casual, too detached – that betrayed her enthusiasm.  And Jess knew why.  Grandpa never gave his pictures names.   He just painted them and left others to make sense of them, if they could.  Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had scrawled there.  Jess read them aloud.  ‘River Boy.’  The words seemed to carry a strange resonance, as though they were somehow important to her, yet why that should be so she could not tell.  And there was a further mystery.  She looked round at Mum.  ‘There is no boy.’\n‘Exactly.  Strange, isn’t it – I mean, for him to be so specific.  Still, he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he’s going to put the boy in later.  I made the mistake of asking him about it.’  ‘Mum!  You should have known better.’  ‘I know, but I couldn’t resist it.  It’s such an unusual picture, especially having a name.  I suppose you can guess the response.’  Jess didn’t need to guess.  She knew what Grandpa’s response would have been.  ‘He told you it’s not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and its own language, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don’t.  And he said painting’s hard enough work as it is without having to waste time telling every idiot …’  ‘Ignoramus, he said.’  ‘… every ignoramus what the thing means.  And if artists had to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along, they’d never get any work done.  And he said …’.  Mum interrupted her, laughing.  ‘Something like that.  Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, seeing as you seem to be a sort of muse for him.’  ‘Muse?’  ‘Someone who inspires an artist.’\nShe knew what the word meant.  Grandpa had often used it when she went to watch him paint, but, generally, it was just to say that the muse wasn’t being kind to him today, or that he’d have to be nice to the muse today as he had a difficult bit to work on, or something like that.  He’d never suggested the muse had anything to do with her.  Indeed, she’d always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being at all.  And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, having any influence over someone as wilful as Grandpa.  ‘He doesn’t need me to inspire him,’ she said.  ‘He’s been painting all his life.’",

    "title": "My Tiny Bedroom",
    "text": "When I woke up this morning, I didn’t mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet.  Not that I’m claiming it was an accident, exactly, though it could have been.  Like if I’d tripped over the edge of the bed, for instance, with Dad’s Stanley knife clutched in my hand, the blade might well have gone plunging into the carpet all by itself and carved a huge great chunk out of it.  I mean, that is what could quite easily have happened.  I’m not saying that it did, just that it could have. \nAll I’m saying is, I didn’t mean to damage the carpet.  It wasn’t like I woke up in the morning and thought, ‘Today I shall cut a hole in my carpet.’  It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do.  Then afterwards you wonder why you thought that, only by then it’s too late.  This is something that happens to me rather a lot.  I’m very unfortunate in that way. \nWhat I was doing, in actual fact, wasn’t thinking about cutting holes so much as trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner.  Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat.  It’s really cute!  Very small and painted white, with pink and blue flowers all running round the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors.  Gran used to keep china ornaments in there:  shepherdesses and milkmaids and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons.  I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.  Gran knew I’d always loved her corner cabinet.  I was so excited when she gave it to me!  But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet.  That is why it is shaped like a triangle.  It has to stand in a corner. \nI’ve only got two corners in my bedroom.  This is because it’s the smallest room in the house, tucked away under the roof, and is shaped like a wedge of cheese.  The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the one the size of a broom cupboard belongs to me.  Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his.  And when Tom goes to University, I can take my pick.  But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems to me I’m going to be stuck in my broom cupboard for years to come.  I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom.  It’s cosy, like a nest.  And I love the way the roof slopes down, and the way the window is at floor level.  \nThe only problem is, the lack of corners!  My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.  I’d tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall.  If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...  That was when it came to me.  If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet?  It just seemed like the obvious solution.  What Dad calls lateral thinking.  I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me.  He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’.  And that was exactly what I was doing!",

    "title": "Philosophy needs to engage more with the world\nPhilosopher Adrian Small considers the role of philosophers in modern life",
    "text": "‘What do you do for a living?’ It’s classic small talk – we define ourselves by our jobs. And it’s a question usually answered in a few words. However, when you’re a philosopher, as I am, it’s slightly harder to deal with. For one thing, describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows. This is clearly nonsense; philosophers are no different from – indeed are part of – the masses, but the persistence of the notion makes me hesitate.\nSo why does this stereotype of a philosopher pervade? One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, was the most virtuous of all. Few modern philosophers would agree, but there’s still a cultural aura around philosophy that associates it, rightly, with the life of the mind. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, remarked that ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’, meaning that a life that simply accepted prevailing cultural norms would be deeply unsatisfying. It’s partly mankind’s innate ability to reflect upon the world that allows us control over our lives, and therefore the ability to make our own decisions. \nBut the examined life doesn’t require the wide reading of the philosophical classics, nor a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define our lives to ensure they deserve their central role. It doesn’t need to be the life of the sage, removed from society in order to evaluate it impartially. In fact, in order for the examined life to serve in guiding the experience of individuals, it’s actually a deeply practical enterprise, and one in which knowledge should be shared, as it’s an essential element of the good life.\nThis brings me to a second reason for the misconception about philosophers: in becoming a profession, academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences, especially those of people without formal training in the discipline. This isn’t entirely the fault of philosophers: university funding, performance evaluations and esteem are tied to increasingly expensive and inaccessible academic journals. As a result, philosophers have little opportunity to explain their ideas to anyone other than the minute group of experts who populate their particular field of study. For the lay observer, the discipline can often seem far removed from reality.\nIf the bulk of philosophers once challenged this view of themselves as being remote, many have since ceased. Although the university system initiated the environment of privileged isolation, academics haven’t shied away from supporting it. As thinking in some areas has grown increasingly concerned with very specific, technical debates, the process of interpreting them for philosophers working outside the specific subfield can be laborious enough, but trying to do so for the untrained mind becomes almost impossible. Philosophy, in some circles, has withdrawn from society altogether. This trend must be reversed. \nI sometimes describe myself as an ‘ethicist’, because most of my work is in ethics, the field of philosophy concerned with evaluating human activity. More recently, though, I’ve begun to feel that title insufficient to capture my area of inquiry, because ethics is commonly asserted as being connected to formal codes, values and laws. This represents quite a new and largely unconsidered development in philosophical thinking: the field of ethics has colloquially come to refer to applied ethics – a subfield that explores the justice of particular social practices. The task of the ethicist, in modern thinking, is to determine whether or not a certain activity is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. \nThese are important questions, and ones I engage in regularly. However, there’s more to philosophy than this. A typical discussion might, for example, begin by exploring whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) before moving to an exploration of how we think about responsibility, our attitudes towards art, and the influence of market consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.",

    "title": "Being a teenager in the US \nA teenager comments on the way many US teenagers live nowadays.",
    "text": "Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the Student Council president, but she must also have a part-time job, volunteer and, needless to say, she must excel in all of these fields. That's being an American teenager today. Teenage boys and girls can't simply go to school and blend into the background, because average is no longer enough. Mediocrity isn't acceptable and a lack of excessive ambition is considered laziness.\n‘People, often adults, forget how much pressure that teenagers have these days. We have piles of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores and responsibilities at home, all in addition to trying to maintain some sort of social life,’ teenager Kristen Loose says. Despite these stresses being the norm in teenage life today, the negative stereotypes of teenagers still exist, often perpetuated by people in the media. You know what I mean: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless and self-absorbed. While there is evidence that they do exist, lumping the entire generation into such a category is not considered fair by some. ‘A lot of people would assume that we spend the majority of our time with our eyes glued to the television and our hands glued to our cell phones,’ Loose says.\nLoose believes this assumption is largely incorrect. She admits to having her cellphone within a few feet at most times of the day, but not for frivolous purposes. It isn't just a means of texting her friends; it is a tool that teens have embraced to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. It is expected that students today have immediate access to the world and that they be reachable at all times, hence creating what appears to be a cell phone addiction. \nWith the introduction of smart phones, tablets and social media, students can now take their work on the go with them, and do their homework wherever they happen to be. Instead of listening to music on\t\tthe drive to school, they could be listening to downloaded language lessons. In essence, schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate, but now require 24-hour attention from already overworked teens. \nMany teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after school activities, family obligations and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation polled American teenagers and found that about 20 percent of all teens get the recommended nine hours a night. Moreover, 28 percent of teens polled admitted falling asleep in school about once a week, because of sleep deprivation.\nTeenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all of her other activities are accounted for, she gets about 18 hours of leisure time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is anything but impressive. And Olsen rarely wastes those hours on social media or television. Instead, she focuses much of her energy on volunteer work. ‘I think that the stereotype of teenagers is that they have a narrow view of the world, that their only focus is on themselves and their own personal and immediate interests,’ Olsen says.\nDespite that image of selfish teens, Olsen says that her favorite part of the week is the time she spends volunteering. ‘I have a heart for serving others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and wider community during the week.’ \nIn 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but without a doubt, they will still be proving it wrong and forcing the world forward. There will be another generation of students who are taking the world by storm, all before they leave school.",

    "title": "Pen Hadow – polar explorer\nThe explorer is risking his life in the Arctic again, this time for all of us. Cole Moretonin reports.\n",
    "text": "In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. That meant swimming through unimaginably cold waters, fighting frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he made it to the South Pole as well. Now he is back in the Arctic again, preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious. Explorers are confident, driven individuals. They have to be. This time, however, there is far more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will set out on a three-month, 1,000 kilometre trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before, and he knows the results will be of vital importance to the scientific community. This will be the truest picture yet of what global warming is doing to the ice that covers the polar region.\nThis is a job he was trained for. When he was a child, Pen was cared for by a woman – his father’s old nanny – who had once worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic, and who was hired to toughen the young man up. This she did by sending him out from his home on the Scottish mountains into blizzards and icy gales with as few clothes on as possible. His father passed on a love of frozen adventure, and the boy turned out to have unusual physical endurance.\nPen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. She helps to run his polar guide business and claims to be more worried about him when he’s at home: ‘He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.’ For fun, she once competed against him in a famous mountain event in which riders on horseback race against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen.\nPen and Mary live in the country with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I thought it would be a good idea to say to my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He absolutely took it to heart, asking his mum how she was all the time, but the strain eventually became too much. While it was well intentioned, it was an unfair thing to do.’ For similar reasons he is planning to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them you remind them how far away you are.’\nHe is spending these last days before departure preparing his kit, obsessively. ‘Out on the ice, one is virtually incapable of mending things or doing anything that isn’t absolutely straightforward,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, one of the world’s leading polar explorers, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will be supported by a crew of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is actually more stressful to someone with his mentality, says Pen, and something else is on his mind too. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done far less training than I’m comfortable with.’ Why? ‘Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I’m almost fearful of what I’m going to ask of myself.’\nPen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. ‘Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition,’ he admits, ‘and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and nobody can do it but us,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which are otherwise bizarre and socially redundant, have become hyper-relevant. Suddenly, we’re socially useful again.’",

    "text": "Rose Frost was just sixteen years old, and she was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Jeff, Rose’s father, had an assignment overseas, and her mother Dahlia would be joining him, but Rose and her elder sister Amy were staying in England. Amy would spend the next year completing her final school courses, living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school so it would have been unfair on Amy to move. To Amy’s delight, she had been given the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. The free access to the Internet and phone had also not gone unnoticed. Jeff and Dahlia would be keeping an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. \nAnd so Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. It was only vague holiday memories that Rose recalled of her grandmother, and she had never known her grandfather. When Daisy had offered her granddaughter a place to stay, Rose’s parents had not been enthused by the idea, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble and was relishing the chance to know her granddaughter again. Rose was not entirely sure what her parents enmity was towards her grandma, but there had been a falling out sometime through the years, resulting in summer holidays spent elsewhere instead of with the only other family member that Rose knew. Rose had been only ten years old when she last said goodbye but her memories had been happy ones.\nDahlia had indicated that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was a social go-getter and had an uncanny knack of bringing people together. Within a week, Rose was to expect dinner invitations, coffee morning requests, and shopping trips. The thought of it made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not the typical frail old lady figure, and from what Rose could gather, Daisy seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England herself. \nDahlia and Rose had had a 'talk' prior to the move. Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs. But Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time. Surely she could be trusted to do these small things now? She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and most of all she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. \nDaisy had understood. Rose’s mother had duly provided her with a new touch-screen mobile phone complete with video camera for emergencies only, Dahlia had insisted. Rose had been ecstatic. They had all agreed that from now on, it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act mature and make grown-up decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If either of them went too far over the line, they would renegotiate. \nRose had never been a wild child. Her precious few school friends had all been inclined the same way, too, so school reports had always been good and exam results exemplary. This had worked in her favour. In five weeks’ time, Rose would begin the arduous task of starting at a new school, meeting new friends, forming bonds, and basically beginning her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt like a veteran at it now. At least she knew this was the last time as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose it was a new moment in time, a new glass shard in the mosaic that was her life.",

    "text": "Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be really good musicians, opened in London last year, after five years in the USA, where it was voted ‘Best Musical’ four times! But doing the show with an all-British cast of actors was challenging. The UK puts more limits on how many performances young actors can do weekly – in the USA, they’re allowed to do more shows. Because of this, twice as many actors were required here. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award.  Although the theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, it’s been full every night, with everyone wanting to hear the songs that first became popular in America. \nI met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. ‘It’s brilliant that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have normal school lessons each day at the theatre. While the teacher’s great, I miss my old school mates.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre does special deals on tickets for schools. They absolutely loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. \nWhen I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play along with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I wasn’t familiar with. Jamie took me through it and I was very pleased with myself when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s ability and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! \nWhile the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they’ve found it pretty easy. Jamie admitted that the hard part was appearing natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile!\nThe show’s on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing.",

    "text": "Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him. His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C.  Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’\nHe is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’\n‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\n‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’\nNow Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.",

    "text": "It never occurred to me when I was little that gardens were anything less than glamorous places. Grandad’s garden was not situated in some grimy city. Instead it was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude. Grandad’s plot was nothing out of the ordinary when it came to features. He had nothing as grand as a greenhouse, unlike some of his neighbours. Not that they had proper ‘bought’ greenhouses. Theirs were made from old window frames. Patches of plastic would be tacked in place where a carelessly wielded spade had smashed a pane of glass.\nAt home, his son, my father, could be quiet and withdrawn. I wouldn’t want to make him sound humourless. He wasn’t. Silly things would amuse him. He had phrases that he liked to use, ‘It’s immaterial to me’ being one of them. ‘I don’t mind’ would have done just as well but he liked the word ‘immaterial’. Deep down he was probably disappointed that he hadn’t made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. Plumbing was not something he was passionate about. It was just what he did. He was never particularly ambitious, though there was a moment when he and Mum thought of emigrating to Canada, but it came to nothing. Where he came into his own was around the house. He had an ‘eye for the job’. Be it bookshelves or a cupboard – what he could achieve was astonishing.\nMy parents moved house only once in their entire married life. But my mother made up for this lack of daring when it came to furniture. You would just get used to the shape of one chair when another appeared, but the most dramatic change of all was the arrival of a piano. I always wanted to like it but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. ‘They’re too posh’, my mother said and they disappeared while I was at school. There was never any mention of my being allowed to play it. Instead lessons were booked for my sister. When I asked my mother in later life why I wasn’t given the opportunity, her reply was brief: ‘You’d never have practised’.\nOf the three options, moors, woods or river – the river was the one that usually got my vote. On a stretch of the river I was allowed to disappear with my imagination into another world. With a fishing net over my shoulder I could set off in sandals that were last year’s model, with the fronts cut out to accommodate toes that were now right to the end. I’d walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home. After the first disastrous attempts to keep them alive in the back yard, they were tipped back into the water.\nI wanted out of school as soon as possible but that seemed an unlikely prospect until one day my father announced, ‘They’ve got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In one brief moment Dad had gone against his better judgement. He might still have preferred it if I became a carpenter. But I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him was a feeling that things might just turn out for the best. If I stuck at it. Maybe I’m deceiving myself, but I prefer to believe that somewhere in his heart, although he hated gardening himself, he’d watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn’t disappeared.",

    "title": "The Sports Gene: What Makes the Perfect Athlete’ by David Epstein\nRichard Moore reviews a book which challenges the notion that in sport, practice matters more than natural talent.",
    "text": "‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said the golfer Gary Player some half-century ago, giving birth to one of sport’s most famous sayings, one that is valued by the world’s most driven athletes and their coaches.  It is easy to see why.  For one thing, the quote’s source is much disputed – arguments have been made for numerous other golfers of the era.  For another, its meaning is enigmatic.  Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was actually speaking ironically, and his real message was: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’\nUp to a point.  Where that point is, indeed, whether it exists at all, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate – the issue of whether talent is born or acquired – as it applies to sport.  And yet it would be wrong to describe it as a debate; that would imply balance.  Instead, the discussion has seemed as uneven as a basketball game between giants and dwarves: nurture has been victorious – hands down, in fact.  The notion that practice matters more than innate talent – in sport, in music, in business, in anything – owes much to the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson, who is credited as the father of the theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice.\nEricsson’s theory has been enthusiastically taken up, spawning Malcolm Gladwell’s hugely successful Outliers, as well as books with titles such as Talent Is Overrated and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice.  Each of these books arrives at a broadly similar conclusion: that it is practice that matters most; and, taking the theory to its logical conclusion, that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and sufficient to make anyone an expert in anything,’ But, as Epstein argues in this captivating book, and illustrates with countless case studies, it is often neither.\nHis starting point is to highlight a major flaw in much of the work looking into what makes excellent people excellent — in that it tends to focus on excellent people: ‘Science is far better at looking at an elite athlete and retrospectively suggesting why that individual is succeeding.’  Are there other ways of working out why some people have certain abilities, while others don’t, and of teasing apart the aspects that are innate and those that are due to environment, support, opportunity and sheer determination?  Epstein’s quest for answers takes him around the globe, from Kenya to Sweden, and from the Caribbean to the Arctic, and even away from human endeavour.\nIt is the frozen expanses of Alaska where Epstein learns that the decisive factor in the world’s toughest sled dog race might be the husky dogs’ drive and desire, which suggests an overlap between genes and supposedly ‘voluntary’ traits.  Because underlying some interpretations of the 10,000-hours rule is an assumption that commitment and determination can be willed: that they constitute a choice.  Yet what if, as the case of the huskies suggests to Epstein, an individual’s drive might also have a genetic component?  Such examples only serve to emphasise the complexity of the topic.\nEpstein distinguishes between hardware (the product of nature) and software (nurture), and agrees that, in elite athletes, one is useless without the other.  He certainly does not dismiss the importance of training or environment, suggesting that, if he had been raised in the US, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt might have become a decent basketball player instead of the fastest man in history.  But Epstein also looks at cases where the hardware matters to such an extent that genes really cannot be ignored.  He also examines the crucial issue of race and gender.  On the latter, he asks: ‘If only accumulated hours of practice matter, then why do we separate men and women in athletic competition?’  Sometimes the best questions are the most obvious.",

    "text": "I leapt from my bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down on the river bend.  A fresh crack in the ice glistened in the morning sunlight.  I shaded my eyes and looked upstream towards the wall of sandbags, there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted.  My back still ached from lifting them into place.  All last week, I’d worked alongside most of the town’s adult population for long hours, proving I was up to the task.  Not that my grandfather took much notice.\nWith one hand still on the curtain, I swept my eyes along the half-mile ribbon of steaming black water formed by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown.  With fragile ice shelves on either side, the dark open patch was followed by solid ice downstream.  As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I spotted a boy on the far side of the river’s edge.  A boy I didn’t recognise.  I frowned.  Unbelievably, he was attempting to balance on an ice shelf along the water warmed by the factory.  I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket.  I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there – a silver chain my famous grandfather once brought back from an expedition in South America.  Far better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which no one but him, my mom and me know about.  Plus, I have the actual diary that he kept on that journey.  I keep it under my pillow and read bits of it before I fall asleep.  I patted the chain again and made my way towards the kitchen.\n‘Morning, Rex.’  Mom smiled at me as I grabbed a banana off the kitchen counter.  ‘You’re up early for a Saturday.  I’ll cook up brunch after your training session.  Be careful, now.’  ‘Thanks, Mom.’  I headed down the hallway, nearly slamming into Grandpa’s tall thin frame as he stepped out\nof his bedroom.  ‘Can’t you ever watch where you’re going?’ he shouted.  ‘Where are you going, anyway?’  ‘Sorry, Grandpa.  I’m going kayaking.’  As if my wetsuit didn’t make that obvious.  As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning.  Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he loses his temper, but he’s been making it that much harder for me to do lately.\n‘What’s the point of training?  You didn’t win the competition,’ he said.  For a split second, the steel-edged remark hit exactly like he meant it to.  But I took a deep breath and silently counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door shut behind him.  Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile.  ‘Don’t mind him.  He’s…’  ‘…not himself at the moment,’ I finished for her.  I refrained from saying that he’d always been that way.  But, like Mom, I try to go easy on him.\nWhen I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he first showed me photos of him in the National Geographic magazine.  Those faded photos still hang framed on his bedroom wall, above his dust-covered expedition medals and trophies.  But I don’t go into his room anymore.  I’ve got my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, someday soon, maybe, my own face in National Geographic.  And yet, well, a part of me still wants to remain devoted to him, this ill-tempered old man.\nMom smiled.  ‘At least, he’s coming out of his bedroom more.  Have a good session, Rex.  I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!’  I smiled back at her as I peeled my banana.  ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said.  ‘If I come up with sponsors for my expedition.’  She laughed and returned to the kitchen.  I ate my banana and went downstairs.  Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse.",

    "title": "Paula Radcliffe’s record-breaking London marathon run\nOn 13 April 2003, British runner Paula Radcliffe set a world record in the London marathon running 42 kilometres in an amazing 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds.",
    "text": "On that day, as Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line, the press gathered to make sense of her extraordinary run. It was noted that her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Intrigued journalists quizzed her on the benefits of a wonderful natural treatment, emu oil. This was a product Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended, to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training.\nRadcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race. And Hartmann was actually infuriated at this, although he admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was would be thinking it was a risk starting off so fast.\nWith 800m left to run Radcliffe began to calculate. It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking ‘I can run quicker than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.’ Regrettably that was not to be.\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, “I can relax back,” it was always: “keep hitting it as hard as you can.”\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak. She would never run as fast again. She did, however, leave a lasting legacy. Many women were inspired to take up long-distance running.",

    "text": "Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. And so do I. An Atlantic gale threatens to lift and blow us both out like October leaves, over the steep cliff at our feet and across the bay 120m below, dropping us in the surrounding ocean. Then MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, creeps up and his blond, bearded owner strokes him with gentle hands. The howling wind, rage as it might, can’t make this man uncomfortable here, on his island, where he looks – and is – perfectly at home.\nMacEwen is giving me a visual tour of his neighbourhood. Nodding to the north, he yells, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west of it is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I watch heavy clouds dump rain on its huge mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ ‘I have sheep to move,’ MacEwen abruptly announces when rain drifts towards us. We start down the slopes. As we stride along, he brings me up to speed on island details: Volcanic Muck is  three km long and half as wide; its geese eat vast amounts of grass; and the MacEwens have been living here for 3000 years.\nHerding the sheep interrupts the flow of information. Tie, the sheepdog, is circling a flock of sheep – and not doing it well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ meaning the dog should circle to the right. He doesn’t; he goes straight up the middle of the flock, creating confusion. ‘Tie.’ MacEwen’s voice drips disappointment. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed.\nThe Isle of Muck is largely a MacEwen enterprise. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; son Colin, newly married, manages the island cottages; and daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby love the fact that their two boys can wander the island on their own and sail dinghies on summer days. ‘They go out of the door and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But island life has its compromises. For one, electricity is only available part of the time. My first evening, I wait anxiously for the lights to turn on. The next morning I find Mary setting out breakfast by torchlight. But I cope with it – along with no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do too.\nEverything on Muck seems delightfully improbable. The boat today brings over some groceries – and three musicians, who hop off carrying instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom proves a smash hit, with the islanders present tapping their boots in time to the music. That night, sitting by a glowing fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay advertised in the newspaper, and bought it without even looking at it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know anything about running a farm? ‘She had good typing skills.’\nI go to bed with rain and awake to more rain. But I eat well, virtually every last morsel of food coming from the tiny island. Mary sends me down to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, delicious beyond reckoning. Also beyond reckoning: my ferry ride the following morning to my next island. Over the preceding two months, many of the scheduled ferries had been cancelled because of high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, phone or no phone, was what I secretly longed for.",

    "title": "Blogging: Confessing to the world",
    "text": "Some time ago a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your whereabouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, ‘Hey, I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous – and we are lost. \nDepressing? Perhaps, but don’t give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity’s temptations and perils – all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it’s worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. \nIn January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the ‘WWW’, as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at Cern, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once.\nHall’s ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall’s site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he’d fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told ‘either the blog goes, or I do’. He’d published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, ‘it makes people not trust me’. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to ‘make people want to be with you’, you’ll be disappointed. \nIn 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong’s blog to every vice president at her company – including some whom she’d mocked – and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the ‘online distribution effect’: that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we’d never dream of saying in person. But the web isn’t some king of alternative reality where we can let our hair down without worrying about repercussions. Our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes.\nArmstrong’s saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of ‘mommy bloggers’ and her writing supports her household. Once a poster-child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should.",

    "text": "A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience? I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets.\nA mate of mine happened to be getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. \nI’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock.\nI got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend,  I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.",

    "title": "Total perfection",
    "text": "When my first cookery programme In Search of Perfection first came out, I had no idea how it would be received by the viewers and the press. There had been plenty of talk going round at the time about the food ‘revolution’ sweeping through Britain, and I was certain that we’d produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that, but still the question worried me: would people appreciate an approach to cooking that involved not just techniques but also history, nostalgia and science? I watched the first programme in a mixed state of joy and fear.\nI needn’t have worried. The subsequent success of the show paved the way for all sorts of other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project there is a sense of being on a journey, be it into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these, however, the journey was often a very physical one, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, and in it you’ll zigzag the globe in order to meet some extraordinary artisans, such as a man who finds his true purpose in creating a golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent decades pursuing their own ideals of perfection.\nPerfection is, of course, highly subjective. Even the seemingly simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a nightmare, and I knew I was bound to upset many people by leaving out their particular favourite. ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ I could imagine people saying. Nevertheless, after shutting ourselves away in a meeting room and agreeing not to emerge until we had come up with a suitable list, the TV production team and I eventually had something for everyone.\nThis reinforced my opinion that each of us has our own idea of what constitutes perfection, drawing heavily on a highly personalised mix of emotions, memories and surroundings. Despite the book’s title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn’t be claiming the recipes were in any way ‘definitive’. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, by talking to food producers and artisans and chefs and their customers, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.\nWhile the dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as the state of being perfect, it also offers a second definition of equal importance to this book: honing through continual experimentation. Trying out ideas and then revising them until you’ve got something unique. The TV series gave me the opportunity to get out and look into all sorts of foods, people and places I’d never encountered before in any restaurant, and I was as excited about that as I was about the chance to explore memory and nostalgia in food because I started out in this business in exactly the same way.\nSearching out the best ingredients for the recipes took me all over the globe. Among my adventures were: being taken with great solemnity and assurance to a canning factory that turned out to be processing completely the wrong sort of tomato, and visiting a dairy farm whose standards fell so far short of perfection that we had to stop filming there! Refining the technique for each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and then using dry ice to turn it into ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine and nearly burning my house down in an effort to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza.",

    "title": "American Black Ducks\nby Sam Prentice, wildlife biologist",
    "text": "I work at a US university where my team and I are trying to learn more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. And we’ve just started using an exciting piece of equipment called a ‘night-vision scope’, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark! \nWe’re worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. There’s lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn.\nIt is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We’ve studied ducks in different locations, and I’ve had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. \nStill I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!",

    "title": "Rollercoasters\nJournalist Kashmira Gander found out about how rollercoasters are designed.",
    "text": "Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Palms clammy with fear, nails digging into the harness, you come to a grinding halt and inhale sharply before the carriage creeps slowly upwards. A pause. Then a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. Teeth gritted, you hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, then upside down. Your senses a blur, you let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut. But you only have yourself to blame: after all, like hundreds of millions of others each year, you were happy to pay the price of getting into a theme park.\nWhat’s somewhat mystifying to me is that amusement parks, with their hair-raising rides aimed at pulling in crowds, are a huge industry. To deliver the thrills and ultimate-escape-from-reality that guests seek, behind the scenes there are huge teams of highly inventive – and arguably a little cruel – structural, mechanical, industrial and electrical engineers, as well as designers and marketing experts.\n‘Rollercoaster designer’ sounds like the career aspiration of a primary school child when asked what they want to be when they grow up. In reality, it’s a big challenge: not just creating the perfect balance of pleasure and fear while ensuring that passengers are not in any danger; but also introducing enough novelty to keep visitors wanting more.\nFor, while the layperson may imagine that rollercoasters have become ever more intense, in fact most of the techniques used today – including the wheel that allows rides to go upside-down – were invented by the US designer John Miller in the early 20th century. In his pre-regulation ‘golden age’, the extremities of rollercoasting were explored – to the discomfort of many passengers – but now creators are limited to the track designs offered by specialist ride manufacturers.\nI spoke to three experts on rollercoasters. ‘The skill,’ said Professor Brendan Walker, a ‘thrill engineer’ with a background in aeronautics, ‘is in compiling the pieces.’ And what that means, said Dr John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, is ‘swapping very rapidly between plus and minus, so people get the sense of being sort of thrown around but kept safe. It’s a very fine line between people feeling the ride is thrilling and that feeling they’ve been bumped around.’\nIn the search for a superlative ride, the teams behind rollercoasters must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle, that works with any innovations – the tallest ride, the most twists, the steepest drops – to create a seamless experience. However, said Professor Walker, in the end, as in many creative industries, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work. ‘It helps to be a bit of a thrill-nut if you are designing rollercoasters, in order to understand exactly what passengers are looking for, and to test your rides before they are opened to the public,’ agreed Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development.\nSurely, though, I asked them, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality? Walker said we shouldn’t hold our breath. ‘Virtual reality can add a veneer, but only in the way that an old fashioned rollercoaster was fantastically painted,’ he said. ’New technology comes along all the time, and the parks are very quick to embrace it because it is exciting and can add to ride experience. But underpinning that is the physical coaster experience, and I think that will remain king for many years to come.’",

    "title": "A career in music\nReporter Eamonn Forde met UK songwriter and music producer Jamie Scott.",
    "text": "Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits of recent years. His is a story of why endurance and persistence are essential in the music business – even if, initially, your career seems only to consist of false starts. He says his mother was ‘an amazing singer’ who also got him started on the guitar. The only radio he heard in his house was a local radio station for middle-aged people, which goes some way to explaining what influenced him as he was growing up. He says he was 12 before he heard a contemporary song. At about the same time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at national level, and music – he was spending his lunchtimes in the music room at school working out songs on the piano. ‘With the tennis playing, I was at quite a high level,’ he says. ‘But it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was just too much hard work.’\nAt 17, he left school to try to make it as a performer. He was part of a duo with a friend who, while not sharing his enthusiasm for making a career out of performing, was a reasonably accomplished guitarist. ‘I went to my parents and I just broke down,’ he recalls. ‘I told them this is what I wanted to do, that I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons and I had been playing the piano every day when everyone else was out playing.’ His dad gave him a deadline of 18 months to make it; if he didn’t, he would have to get a job. After a few near misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher when he was 19, off the back of one song. However, record labels were only interested in him as a solo act and so he had to split with his friend.\nIn the end, it was behind the scenes rather than on stage where he would make his name. After a difficult period signed to a record label in the UK, he asked them to let him go and he switched to another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not follow. ‘It feels like to me in my own artist career that, I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of that time,’ he says. ‘But as a writer I’ve been in the right place at the right time.’\nWriting for others is where he was to really find his feet. ‘I’d like to think that I am one of the main writers in the UK that UK labels look to send up-and-coming artists to’ he says. This, he believes, helps launch their careers.\nSometimes he has to explain to the artists he's helping that writing with an eye on the charts is nothing to be ashamed of. ‘Why? Why don’t you want to? Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month? I’m not saying that they should write a bad song, but we should get to something that they think is amazing and that I think is amazing and something that’s likely to sell well too.’\nIt is refreshing in an age of false modesty in the world of pop music to hear someone speak so bluntly about wanting to write huge songs that go to number one. There is no sense of arrogance or entitlement with Scott; he just realised long ago that he wants to write number ones and that he has a natural ability to do it. So, rather than tie himself in knots trying to make himself sound acceptable to other people, he just gets on with it.\n‘That’s the endgame for when I go into the studio with someone,’ he says. ‘Whatever happens, we need to state that this is on the global level and that we need to write the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’",

    "title": "The Lucy Variations",
    "text": "Lucy was talking at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom to two of the other pianists playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival but, unlike her, not competing: a guy from Tokyo and a girl from a European city Lucy didn’t quite catch over the noise, whose name was Liesel or Louisa or something. They were both older than she was by about ten years, both good enough English speakers to talk about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next. \n‘I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,’ Lucy told them. \nIt sounded impressive. Not that she wanted to go to the Tanglewood festival. As she hadn’t wanted to do so many of the things that filled her time: the concerts and competitions that took her around the world and caused her to miss such massive chunks of school that she wasn’t officially enrolled any more. Instead she worked with various tutors from the University of San Francisco.\nShe hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only took fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she’d made it. There’d been a party. Lucy’s dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn’t even applied. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. \n‘I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,’ her mom had said. \nRight, Lucy had thought. More like you didn't want to give me the chance to say no. \nThat was when Lucy still believed that rocking the boat was the worst thing a person could do, and it didn't even cross her mind to try to get out of it.\nThe guy from Tokyo leaned forwards as if he had misheard her.\n‘Tanglewood?’\n‘Yeah.’ \n‘How old are you? \n‘Fifteen.’ \nHe exchanged a glance with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ \nLucy hadn’t meant to brag. It could be hard to find the line between sharing credentials in an effort to fit in and showing off. \n‘It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try...’ \n‘Excuse me,’ Liesel/Louisa said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she had to go talk to. Tokyo stayed. \n‘Have you ever been to Japan?’ He had long, shaggy hair, like a lot of the guy musicians had, to show the world they may be music nerds but they were rebel music nerds. ‘Once. When I was, like, eight.’ \nHe started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared at her elbow. \n‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.’ He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. ‘And don't get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition.’\n‘Everyone is the competition.’ \nHer grandfather ferried her around the room and made her talk to everyone he thought important. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, hearing about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after they'd left the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’ \nShe did like that part. Being somebody. Even if it meant certain people were jealous or thought she was too young to get the kind of attention she did. Being a concert pianist didn't win her any special respect from the kids she’d been at school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know and wouldn't care that she could nail a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered.",

    "title": "THE FUTURE OF NEWSPAPERS",
    "text": "Anybody who says they can reliably forecast the future of newspapers is either a liar or a fool. Look at the raw figures, and newspapers seem doomed. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has fallen by between a third and half. The authoritative Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26 per cent of US citizens as against 45 per cent in 2001. There is no shortage of prophets who confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will be safely buried within 15 years at most.\nYet one of the few reliable facts of history is that old media have a habit of surviving. An over-exuberant New York journalist announced in 1835 that books and theatre ‘have had their day’ and the daily newspaper would become ‘the greatest organ of social life’. Theatre duly withstood not only the newspaper, but also cinema and then television. Radio has flourished in the TV age; cinema, in turn, has held its own against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales up 745 per cent since 2008.\nNewspapers themselves were once new media, although it took several centuries before they became the dominant medium for news. This was not solely because producing up-to-date news for a large readership over a wide area became practicable and economic only in the mid-19th century, with the steam press, the railway and the telegraph. Equally important was the emergence of the idea that everything around us is in constant movement and we need to be updated on its condition at regular intervals – a concept quite alien in medieval times and probably also to most people in the early modern era. Now, we expect change. To our medieval ancestors, however, the only realities were the passing of the seasons, punctuated by catastrophes such as famine, flood or disease that they had no reliable means of anticipating. Life, as the writer Alain de Botton puts it, was ‘ineluctably cyclical’ and ‘the most important truths were recurring’.\nJournalism as a full-time trade from which you could hope to make a living hardly existed before the 19th century. Even then, there was no obvious reason why most people needed news on a regular basis, whether daily or weekly. In some respects, regularity of newspaper publication and rigidity of format was, and remains, a burden.  Online news readers can dip in and out according to how they perceive the urgency of events. Increasingly sophisticated search engines and algorithms allow us to personalise the news to our own priorities and interests. When important stories break, internet news providers can post minute-by-minute updates. Error, misconception and foolish speculation can be corrected or modified almost instantly. There are no space restrictions to prevent narrative or analysis, and documents or events cited in news stories can often be accessed in full. All this is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication. Yet few if any providers seem alive to the new medium’s capacity for spreading understanding and enlightenment.\nInstead, the anxiety is always to be first with the news, to maximise reader comments, to create heat, sound and fury and thus add to the sense of confusion. In the medieval world, what news there was was usually exchanged amid the babble of the marketplace or the tavern, where truth competed with rumour, mishearing and misunderstanding. In some respects, it is to that world that we seem to be returning. Newspapers have never been very good – or not as good as they ought to be – at telling us how the world works. Perhaps they now face extinction. Or perhaps, as the internet merely adds to what de Botton describes as our sense that we live in ‘an unimprovable and fundamentally chaotic universe’, they will discover that they and they alone can guide us to wisdom and understanding.",

    "title": "DESPERATELY SEEKING SUCCESS\nOliver Burkeman suggests that the path to contentment is to learn to be a loser.",
    "text": "In a storehouse in an unremarkable business park in Michigan, USA, lies consumer capitalism’s graveyard – the shadow side to the upbeat, success-focused culture of modern marketing.  It’s almost certainly the only place you’ll find A Touch of Yogurt shampoo alongside the equally unpopular Breakfast Cola.  The collection – now owned by a company called GfK – is informally known as the Museum of Failed Products.  Its exhibits are products withdrawn from sale because almost nobody wanted to buy them.  The museum’s proprietor, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story on the part of designers, marketers and salespeople.  By far the most striking thing about the museum, though, is that it should exist as a viable, profit-making business at all.  You might have assumed that any manufacturer worthy of the name would have its own such collection.  Yet the executives who arrive every week are evidence of how rarely this happens.  They were apparently so averse to dwelling on the business of failure that they had neglected to keep samples of their own disasters.\nThe museum was itself a kind of accident, albeit a happier one.  Its originator, ex-marketing man Robert McMath, merely intended to accumulate a ‘reference library’ of consumer products, not failures per se.  And so, starting in the 1960s, he began purchasing a sample of every new item he could find.  What McMath hadn’t taken into account was the three-word truth that was to prove the making of his career: ‘Most products fail.’  Simply by collecting new products indiscriminately, McMath had ensured that his hoard would come to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful ones.\nIt isn’t hard to imagine how today’s culture of optimism might be responsible for the goods lining the museum’s shelves.  Each one must have made it through a series of meetings where nobody realised the product was doomed.  Even if they did, there’s a perverse incentive for marketers to plough more money into a loser: thereby forcing some sales and preserving their dignity. Little energy will have been invested in discovering what went wrong with the products; everyone involved will have conspired, perhaps unwittingly, never to speak of it again.\nThis obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the burgeoning ‘self-help’ field.  A favoured approach here ‘positive visualisation’: if you mentally picture things turning out well, they’re far more likely to do so – or so the reasoning goes. Indeed, a predisposition to look on the bright side may be so intertwined with our survival that evolution has skewed us that way.  In fact, neuroscientist Tali Sharot has compiled growing evidence that a well-functioning mind may be built to perceive the odds of things going well as greater than they really are.  Well-balanced people, her research suggests, generally have a less accurate and overly optimistic grasp of their true ability to influence events than do those who are suffering from depression.\nBut just how effective are ‘positive fantasies about the future’?  That is the question which psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her colleagues have sought to answer over recent years.  Their results are striking: spending time and energy thinking about how well things could go, it has emerged, actually depletes most people’s motivation to achieve their goals.  Groups of experimental subjects who were encouraged to think about how they were going to have a particularly high-achieving week at work, for example, ended up achieving less.\nPsychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about the nature of ability.  According to Dweck, people with a ‘fixed theory’ mind-set assume ability is innate; those with an ‘incremental theory’ believe it evolves through challenge and hard work.  Fixed-theory people find failure especially horrifying: a sign that they tried to show their ability, but didn’t measure up.  The classic example is the sports star encouraged to think of himself as a ‘natural’ – but who then fails to put in sufficient practice to realise his potential.  Incremental-theory people, meanwhile, view failure as evidence that they are stretching themselves to their current limits.  Dweck draws an analogy here with weight-training: muscles grow by being pushed to the limits of their current capacity, where fibres tear and reheal, ending up stronger than before, but the deeper point is that possessing an incremental outlook is a happier way to  be, whether or not it leads to success.

    "title": "Unlimited time off work\nBarnaby Spence considers a new idea from the world of big business\n",
    "text": "The founder of a multinational corporation recently announced that his company would no longer be keeping track of its employees’ paid holiday time. The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy. According to the founder of the multinational corporation, the idea came to him via a cheery email (reproduced in many newspapers) from his daughter. In it she sounds suspiciously like a copywriter from her father’s media team. Setting aside the fact that the means by which the announcement was made seems like a hollow attempt at ‘humanising’ what may turn out to be a less than generous policy decision, let us ask: is the idea practical?\nThe internet company and the multinational corporation are fundamentally distinct – the former has 2,000 employees and provides a single service, while the latter has 50,000 employees with dozens of subsidiary companies providing services as diverse as financial services, transport, and healthcare. The approach of ‘take as much time off as you want as long as you’re sure it won’t damage the business’ seems better suited to a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules, and so may be more comfortable in assessing whether their absence would harm the business – in any case a problematically abstract notion.\nThe founder of the multinational has stated that his employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they ‘feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business –  or, for that matter, their careers.’ Is it possible to be that sure? No matter how many loose ends you manage to tie up in advance of a holiday, there is always a mountain of work to come back to. That is simply the nature of leave; you put your work on hold, but its accumulation is inevitable and beyond your control. Someone who follows these guidelines would likely not go at all, or, at the very least, would feel overly guilty about going. Increased levels of guilt lead to stress and this, together with workers not taking sufficient leave, would lead to a decrease in productivity in the long run.\nThe situation could be compounded by pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Such pressure already affects decisions such as when to start and end the working day. Particularly in the corporate sector, there is a culture of working late, and it is easy to see how this could translate into a ‘no holiday’ culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotion. Similarly, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Essentially, they would no longer have their legal entitlement to fall back on. Perhaps then, the policy would result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave, or, they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete.\nModern technology, which allows us to receive work messages whenever and wherever we are, has blurred the distinction between work and leisure time. The internet company apparently began their unlimited leave policy when their employees asked how this new way of working could be reconciled with the company’s old-fashioned time-off policy. That is to say, if their employer was no longer able to accurately track employees’ total time on the job, why should it apply a different and outmoded standard to their time away from it? However, a potentially problematic corollary of having no set working hours is that all hours are feasibly working hours. Employees can never be sure whether or not their working hours are being monitored by their employer, causing them to internalise this scrutiny and become self-disciplining, with possibly destructive effects. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity and productivity which are cited as the desired results of the unlimited leave policy can all exist independently of worker well-being. I remain doubtful, therefore, as to whether being ‘able to take as much holiday as they want’ is either the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy.",

    "title": "Photographer Vivian Maier\nAlthough Vivian Maier was not famous when she was alive, her photographs are now becoming very popular",
    "text": "When John Maloof bid on a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, little did he know he was stepping deep into the mystery of Vivian Maier. Malloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago, in the US. Instead, what he found were 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images.\nSince then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. Stashed in the attic studio of his home are her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints and 100,000 negatives, as well as many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent weekday morning, Maloof stood in the midst of it all and looked around. He knows he’s on the verge of something pretty cool, and it came about by pure luck. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’\nFor some time now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been stitching together the details of Maier’s life and trying to fill in the blanks. They contacted several local families that employed her as a nanny and talked with employees of the shop where she had film developed. Maier was born in 1926 in new York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who by all accounts kept herself to herself and was a bit of a character, always had a camera with her. She dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes.\n‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be round her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employer Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’\nMaier was knowledgeable about theatre and movies. Although she was by no means sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the street with herm camera and engage people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seems to have been somewhat obsessed with her ‘second job’, documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’\nMaier’s work is the purest form of art; none of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, the abstract. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and he wonders whether she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or was she a lifter of ideas from those who came before her?’\nMaloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives, which he has stored in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures.\n?As I progressed as a photographer and went back and visited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.",

    "text": "I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I knew they went camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking, and these were things I’d never done before. In the NYC you can do different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level you get a certificate.\nWhen I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea; I’d joined that same club when I was eight and I’d found it really difficult to make friends. I was quite shy then and all the other children already had their own friendship groups, so I’d stopped going after a couple of weeks. I decided to take up the challenge though, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate.\nSoon, however, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.\nBecause of what I’ve learnt at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. It wasn’t something I’d ever considered before starting at the club. In fact, I’d never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far and I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping!",
