    "Question": "To put it in the simplest possible terms, I find writing novels a challenge, writing short stories a joy.  If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.  The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.  The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves, which are sometimes dyed a brilliant gold.  Meanwhile, in the garden, buds appear on flowers, and colourful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the subtle transition from one season to the next.\r\nSince the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories.  My pattern has been this: once I finish a novel, I find I want to write some short stories; once a group of short stories is done, then I feel like focusing on a novel.  I never write any short stories while I’m writing a novel, and never write a novel while I’m working on short stories.  The two types of writing may very well engage different parts of the brain, and it takes some time to get off one track and switch to the other.\r\nIt was only after I began my career with two short novels in 1975 that I started, from 1984 to 1985, to write short stories.  I knew little about short-story writing then so it was rough going, but I did find the experience really memorable.  I felt the possibilities of my fictional world expand by several degrees.  And readers seemed to appreciate this other side of me as a writer.  One of my earliest works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.  This was my starting point as a short-story writer.\r\nOne of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take so long to finish.  Generally it takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape (though revisions can be endless).  It’s not like the total physical and mental commitment you have to make for the year or two it takes to compose a novel.  You go into a room, finish your work, and leave.  That’s it.  For me, at least, writing a novel can seem to drag on for ever, and I sometimes wonder if I’m going to survive.  So I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace.\r\nOne more nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story out of the smallest things – an idea that springs up in your mind, a word, an image, whatever.  In most cases it’s like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to.  And another good point is that with short stories you don’t have to worry about failing.  If the idea doesn’t work out the way you hoped it would, you just shrug your shoulders and tell yourself that they can’t all be winners.  Even with masters of the genre like the American writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver, not every short story is a masterpiece.  I find this a great comfort.  You can learn from your mistakes (in other words, those you cannot call a complete success) and use that in the next story you write.  In my case, when I write novels I try very hard to learn from the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories.  In that sense the short story is a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist.  It is hard to experiment the way I like to do inside the framework of a novel, so without short stories I know I would find the task of writing novels even more difficult and demanding.\r\nMy short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind.  I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did.  Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.\r\nThe writer uses the metaphor of a forest and a garden ",

    "Question": "Nearly every weekday morning for a year and a half, I got up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past four hundred years approached this exact same task – that is, how they made the time each day to do their best work, how they organized their schedules in order to be creative and productive. By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives – when they slept and ate and worked and worried – I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,’ the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote. I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.’\r\nIn that sense, this is a superficial book. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. (The novelist John Cheever thought that you couldn’t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self – isn’t that the truth?) My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me? \r\nI don’t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages – probably some of them can’t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises – but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \r\nThe book’s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people’s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot. But in the right hands, your daily routine can be a finely calibrated mechanism for taking advantage of a range of limited resources: time (the most limited resource of all) as well as willpower and optimism. A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. The psychologist William James thought you wanted to put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a chronic procrastinator and could never stick to a regular schedule. \r\nAs it happens, it was an inspired bout of procrastination that led to the creation of this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I’m a classic ‘morning person’, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers’ working schedules. These were easy to find and highly entertaining. It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place – hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \r\nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people’s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I’ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews.

    "Question": "Nearly every weekday morning for a year and a half, I got up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past four hundred years approached this exact same task – that is, how they made the time each day to do their best work, how they organized their schedules in order to be creative and productive. By writing about the admittedly mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives – when they slept and ate and worked and worried – I hoped to provide a novel angle on their personalities and careers, to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit, as one of us. ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are,’ the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote. I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.’\r\nIn that sense, this is a superficial book. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. (The novelist John Cheever thought that you couldn’t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self – isn’t that the truth?) My underlying concerns in the book are issues that I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up (sleep, income, a clean house), or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me? \r\nI don’t pretend to answer these questions in the following pages – probably some of them can’t be answered, or can be resolved only individually, in shaky personal compromises – but I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa. \r\nThe book’s title is Daily Rituals, but my focus in writing it was really people’s routines. The word connotes ordinariness and even a lack of thought; to follow a routine is to be on autopilot. But in the right hands, your daily routine can be a finely calibrated mechanism for taking advantage of a range of limited resources: time (the most limited resource of all) as well as willpower and optimism. A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. The psychologist William James thought you wanted to put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a chronic procrastinator and could never stick to a regular schedule. \r\nAs it happens, it was an inspired bout of procrastination that led to the creation of this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was sitting alone in the dusty offices of the small architecture magazine that I worked for, trying to write a story due the next day. But instead of buckling down and getting it over with, I was compulsively tidying my cubicle, making coffee in the kitchenette, and generally wasting the day. I’m a classic ‘morning person’, capable of considerable focus in the early hours but pretty much useless after lunch. That afternoon, to make myself feel better about this often inconvenient predilection, I started searching the Internet for information about other writers’ working schedules. These were easy to find and highly entertaining. It occurred to me that someone should collect these anecdotes in one place – hence the Daily Routines blog I launched that very afternoon and, now, this book. \r\nThe blog was a casual affair; I merely posted descriptions of people’s routines as I ran across them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and the like. For the book, I’ve pulled together a vastly expanded and better researched collection, while also trying to maintain the brevity and diversity of voices that made the original appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. In other cases, I have cobbled together a summary of their routines from secondary sources. I should note here that this book would have been impossible without the research of the hundreds of biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I drew upon.

    "Question": "Critical, or analytical, thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in attempt to have a deeper understanding. ‘There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth,’ observes Adrian West, research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., and a former computer science lecturer at the University of Manchester. \r\nAlthough there’s little debate that information technology complements – and often enhances – the human mind in the quest to store information and process an ever-growing tangle of bits and bytes, there’s increasing concern that the same technology is changing the way we approach complex problems, and making it more difficult to really think. ‘We’re exposed to greater amounts of poor yet charismatic thinking, the fads of intellectual fashion, opinion, and mere assertion,’ says West. ‘The wealth of communications and information can easily overwhelm our reasoning abilities.’ What’s more, it’s ironic that ever-growing piles of data and information do not equate to greater knowledge and better decision-making. What’s remarkable, West says, is just ‘how little this has affected the quality of our thinking.’\r\nAccording to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading, for one thing, has declined 10 percentage points, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Many, including Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles, believe that a greater focus on visual media comes at a price. ‘A drop-off in reading has possibly contributed to a decline in critical thinking,’ she says. ‘There is a greater emphasis on real-time media and multi-tasking rather than focusing on a single thing.’ Nevertheless, a definitive answer about how technology affects critical thinking is not yet available. Instead, due to the ever greater presence of technology, critical thinking has landed in a mushy swamp, and academics can no longer rely on fundamental beliefs that they previously held.\r\nWhile it’s tempting to view computers, video games, and the internet in a largely good or bad way, the reality is that they may be both, and different technologies, systems, and uses yield entirely different results. For example, a computer game may promote critical thinking or detract from it. Reading on the internet may ratchet up one’s ability to analyze while chasing an endless array of hyperlinks may undercut deeper thought.\r\nExposure to technology fundamentally changes the way people think, says Greenfield, who recently analyzed more than 50 studies on learning and technology. As visual media have exploded, noticeable changes have resulted, she notes. ‘Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not,’ Greenfield explains. ‘It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary.’ However, she has found that visual media actually improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, ‘most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination,’ she says. The upshot? Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities.\r\nHow society views technology has a great deal to do with how it forms perceptions about critical thinking. And nowhere is the conflict more apparent than at the intersection of video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, points out that things aren’t always as they appear. ‘There is a strong undercurrent of opinion that video and computer games aren’t healthy for kids,’ he says. ‘The reality is that they are not only a major form of entertainment, they often provide a very good tool for learning.’ In fact, an expanding body of evidence indicates that joysticks can go a long way toward building smarter children with better reasoning skills. Games such as Sim City and Civilization extend beyond rote memorization, and teach decision-making and analytical skills in immersive, virtual environments that resemble the real world, Gee says. Moreover, these games – and some virtual worlds – give participants freedom to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.\r\nIt’s certain that in the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it’s time to take a closer look at technology and understand the subtleties of how it affects thinking and analysis.\r\nIn the second paragraph, it is said that information technology",

    "Question": "When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic, a job he turned to after becoming disillusioned with office life and his work for social policy institutions. His first book was a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. His most recent one is a kind of philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was out shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine during a delay of just a few seconds while he entered his pin number. \r\nCrawford says he realised that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. What we want to be at the forefront of our mind at any particular moment is a very personal matter, and we are being prevented from deciding this for ourselves by something which we are, in the main, unaware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think, or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers. ‘We increasingly encounter the world through these representations that are addressed to us, often with manipulative intent: video games, apps on your phone,’ says Crawford. They reflect all our desires perfectly, and end up taking over. \r\nCrawford is not the only one who is worried. Everyone knows that office worker who complains about emails all day and then spends their free time doing email. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table – a familiar phenomenon to those of us who have sat bored at dinner, feeling the gravitational draw of the black square in our pocket. There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837. But it’s indisputable that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. A world of constant choice means that our powers of self-control are heavily taxed, and this has a social impact. \r\nWe’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation. By only engaging with representations of people rather than people themselves, Crawford argues, we risk losing something fundamental in our society. And screens are only part of the problem. He gives his gym as an example. There used to be a single music player in the middle of the room, available to everyone. People didn’t all like the same music and that could lead to tension. Now people tend to listen to their own music on ear buds. ‘The gym used to be a social place and it has lost that character. Genuine connection to other people tends to happen in the context of conflict – having a contest of different people’s tastes and working it out,’ he says. \r\nCrawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.

    "Question": "When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic, a job he turned to after becoming disillusioned with office life and his work for social policy institutions. His first book was a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. His most recent one is a kind of philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was out shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine during a delay of just a few seconds while he entered his pin number. \r\nCrawford says he realised that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. What we want to be at the forefront of our mind at any particular moment is a very personal matter, and we are being prevented from deciding this for ourselves by something which we are, in the main, unaware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think, or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers. ‘We increasingly encounter the world through these representations that are addressed to us, often with manipulative intent: video games, apps on your phone,’ says Crawford. They reflect all our desires perfectly, and end up taking over. \r\nCrawford is not the only one who is worried. Everyone knows that office worker who complains about emails all day and then spends their free time doing email. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table – a familiar phenomenon to those of us who have sat bored at dinner, feeling the gravitational draw of the black square in our pocket. There’s no scientific evidence yet on whether our attention spans have been affected – there have been fears of this kind since the telegraph was invented in 1837. But it’s indisputable that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. A world of constant choice means that our powers of self-control are heavily taxed, and this has a social impact. \r\nWe’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation. By only engaging with representations of people rather than people themselves, Crawford argues, we risk losing something fundamental in our society. And screens are only part of the problem. He gives his gym as an example. There used to be a single music player in the middle of the room, available to everyone. People didn’t all like the same music and that could lead to tension. Now people tend to listen to their own music on ear buds. ‘The gym used to be a social place and it has lost that character. Genuine connection to other people tends to happen in the context of conflict – having a contest of different people’s tastes and working it out,’ he says. \r\nCrawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player and a motorbike racer as people whose roles force them to deal with material reality.

    "Question": "‘What do you do for a living?’ It’s classic small talk – we define ourselves by our jobs. And it’s a question usually answered in a few words. However, when you’re a philosopher, as I am, it’s slightly harder to deal with. For one thing, describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows. This is clearly nonsense; philosophers are no different from – indeed are part of – the masses, but the persistence of the notion makes me hesitate.\r\nSo why does this stereotype of a philosopher pervade? One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, was the most virtuous of all. Few modern philosophers would agree, but there’s still a cultural aura around philosophy that associates it, rightly, with the life of the mind. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, remarked that ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’, meaning that a life that simply accepted prevailing cultural norms would be deeply unsatisfying. It’s partly mankind’s innate ability to reflect upon the world that allows us control over our lives, and therefore the ability to make our own decisions. \r\nBut the examined life doesn’t require the wide reading of the philosophical classics, nor a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define our lives to ensure they deserve their central role. It doesn’t need to be the life of the sage, removed from society in order to evaluate it impartially. In fact, in order for the examined life to serve in guiding the experience of individuals, it’s actually a deeply practical enterprise, and one in which knowledge should be shared, as it’s an essential element of the good life.\r\nThis brings me to a second reason for the misconception about philosophers: in becoming a profession, academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences, especially those of people without formal training in the discipline. This isn’t entirely the fault of philosophers: university funding, performance evaluations and esteem are tied to increasingly expensive and inaccessible academic journals.

    "Question": "‘What do you do for a living?’ It’s classic small talk – we define ourselves by our jobs. And it’s a question usually answered in a few words. However, when you’re a philosopher, as I am, it’s slightly harder to deal with. For one thing, describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows. This is clearly nonsense; philosophers are no different from – indeed are part of – the masses, but the persistence of the notion makes me hesitate.\r\nSo why does this stereotype of a philosopher pervade? One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, was the most virtuous of all. Few modern philosophers would agree, but there’s still a cultural aura around philosophy that associates it, rightly, with the life of the mind. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, remarked that ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’, meaning that a life that simply accepted prevailing cultural norms would be deeply unsatisfying. It’s partly mankind’s innate ability to reflect upon the world that allows us control over our lives, and therefore the ability to make our own decisions. \r\nBut the examined life doesn’t require the wide reading of the philosophical classics, nor a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define our lives to ensure they deserve their central role. It doesn’t need to be the life of the sage, removed from society in order to evaluate it impartially. In fact, in order for the examined life to serve in guiding the experience of individuals, it’s actually a deeply practical enterprise, and one in which knowledge should be shared, as it’s an essential element of the good life.\r\nThis brings me to a second reason for the misconception about philosophers: in becoming a profession, academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences, especially those of people without formal training in the discipline. This isn’t entirely the fault of philosophers: university funding, performance evaluations and esteem are tied to increasingly expensive and inaccessible academic journals.

    "Question": "Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who treasure food might expect that critical reflection on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. Historically however, philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to gaining insight into other philosophical issues. So when philosophers have talked of eating, it has actually served as a metaphor for some other topic, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that do appear superficially to be about food. However, further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. \r\nIt is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but did so across a range of human activities. Nonetheless, the name of Epicurus has grown synonymous with a passion for eating and drinking; in addition to casual speech, we see it invoked in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites, among others. Presumably these commercial interests expect some return if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers. \r\nWhatever else food is, it is inherently social and cultural. The food that we eat does not appear from nowhere, but rather derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\r\nOnce food has been prepared, critics will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected since, philosophically, the perception mechanisms underlying taste have not received much attention. Nearly all of the literature on perception has focussed on vision and this should be remedied. \r\nAnother aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit. \r\nThere are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. Most generally, we can ask what should we eat: organic; free-range; locally grown; vegetarian; foods that are not genetically modified? Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food. \r\nA separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks, it seems to me, have a special duty to their guests generated by the direct relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included as we come together to share food and companionship. Those who cook for a living, on the other hand, have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. This means that their kitchens are not open to all, but only those who are suitably qualified, and their relationships are those of colleagues, not friends. \r\nA recent essay titled ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ examines the ways in which food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. This takes place in two ways. First, we can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food. Second, we forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat – a practice with a long history in international diplomacy.

    "Question": "Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who treasure food might expect that critical reflection on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. Historically however, philosophical discussions of food have been subordinate to gaining insight into other philosophical issues. So when philosophers have talked of eating, it has actually served as a metaphor for some other topic, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that do appear superficially to be about food. However, further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. \r\nIt is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but did so across a range of human activities. Nonetheless, the name of Epicurus has grown synonymous with a passion for eating and drinking; in addition to casual speech, we see it invoked in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites, among others. Presumably these commercial interests expect some return if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers. \r\nWhatever else food is, it is inherently social and cultural. The food that we eat does not appear from nowhere, but rather derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed. Indeed, the wonder of food is that we interact with it more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity that comes to mind, making it an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.\r\nOnce food has been prepared, critics will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected since, philosophically, the perception mechanisms underlying taste have not received much attention. Nearly all of the literature on perception has focussed on vision and this should be remedied. \r\nAnother aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. Aesthetic objects must persist across time, so it is quite erroneous to think that food could be a proper object of aesthetic merit. \r\nThere are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. Most generally, we can ask what should we eat: organic; free-range; locally grown; vegetarian; foods that are not genetically modified? Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food. \r\nA separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks, it seems to me, have a special duty to their guests generated by the direct relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included as we come together to share food and companionship. Those who cook for a living, on the other hand, have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. This means that their kitchens are not open to all, but only those who are suitably qualified, and their relationships are those of colleagues, not friends. \r\nA recent essay titled ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ examines the ways in which food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. This takes place in two ways. First, we can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food. Second, we forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat – a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. But what is so unexpected is that the text is fleshed out by many wonderful examples and entertaining anecdotes, which brings to life for the general reader this aspect of food philosophy.\r\nWhat does the writer find surprising about the essay ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’?",

    "Question": "One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky hauled himself out of his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium, heaved himself across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story fit for a children’s film, and was widely shared online. Part of the fun of the story and other such tales of escape, involving creatures as diverse as rats and llamas, is indulging in a bit of knowing anthropomorphism: animals, they’re just like us! In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced, because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own. How is it that eight-tentacled sea creatures can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as portable armor and even exhibit sophisticated play behavior?\r\nAnthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that it is not in fact anthropomorphising, but its opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals, or what he terms anthropodenial – that has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Analysing decades of animal-cognition research, he shows that, with the exception of fully-developed language, animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals: the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. Animals, in other words, are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.\r\nAnthropodenial, in de Waal’s opinion, is a relatively modern phenomenon. In medieval and early modern Europe, the animal mind was considered sophisticated enough that animals could be put on trial for crimes. And as recently as the nineteenth century, many naturalists sought out the connections between human and animal intelligence. ‘The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind,’ one nineteenth-century naturalist wrote. And this was no radical supporter of animal rights; it was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution changed the way we understand our place in the world.\r\nThe advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on conditioning animals through reward and punishment, shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, the two dominant schools of thought viewed animals as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Anyone who thought about animals having internal lives was dismissed as romantic, or unscientific. It is perhaps no accident that this shift occurred during the same century that saw humans tearing down animal habitats at unprecedented rates, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock which ignored the welfare of the animals.\r\nHappily, de Waal believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. ‘The times are changing,’ he writes. ‘Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last few decades, diffused over the internet.’ The most effective tests of animal intelligence, he argues, are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but whereas we need apps to find our misplaced phones, they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery points out that if an octopus were to measure human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us fail the test, it might conclude that we are pretty stupid.\r\nDe Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to a drain leading to the ocean.  But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. When the monkeys were rewarded with either cucumbers (a well-liked monkey food) or grapes (an even better one), those given cucumbers shrieked and raged at seeing their peers get the superior treat. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later. Just one of the oddities of our particular kind of animal mind.\r\nWhat point does the writer make about octopuses in the first paragraph?",

And this was no radical supporter of animal rights; it was Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution changed the way we understand our place in the world.\r\nThe advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century, with its emphasis on conditioning animals through reward and punishment, shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, the two dominant schools of thought viewed animals as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Anyone who thought about animals having internal lives was dismissed as romantic, or unscientific. It is perhaps no accident that this shift occurred during the same century that saw humans tearing down animal habitats at unprecedented rates, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock which ignored the welfare of the animals.\r\nHappily, de Waal believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. ‘The times are changing,’ he writes. ‘Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last few decades, diffused over the internet.’ The most effective tests of animal intelligence, he argues, are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but whereas we need apps to find our misplaced phones, they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery points out that if an octopus were to measure human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us fail the test, it might conclude that we are pretty stupid.\r\nDe Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to a drain leading to the ocean.  But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. When the monkeys were rewarded with either cucumbers (a well-liked monkey food) or grapes (an even better one), those given cucumbers shrieked and raged at seeing their peers get the superior treat. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later. Just one of the oddities of our particular kind of animal mind.\r\nWhat is the main idea put forward in the fifth paragraph?",

    "Question": "One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky hauled himself out of his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium, heaved himself across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story fit for a children’s film, and was widely shared online. Part of the fun of the story and other such tales of escape, involving creatures as diverse as rats and llamas, is indulging in a bit of knowing anthropomorphism: animals, they’re just like us! In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced, because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own. How is it that eight-tentacled sea creatures can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as portable armor and even exhibit sophisticated play behavior?\r\nAnthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that it is not in fact anthropomorphising, but its opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals, or what he terms anthropodenial – that has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Analysing decades of animal-cognition research, he shows that, with the exception of fully-developed language, animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals: the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. Animals, in other words, are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.\r\nAnthropodenial, in de Waal’s opinion, is a relatively modern phenomenon. In medieval and early modern Europe, the animal mind was considered sophisticated enough that animals could be put on trial for crimes. And as recently as the nineteenth century, many naturalists sought out the connections between human and animal intelligence. ‘The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind,’ one nineteenth-century naturalist wrote.

    "Question": "Once confined to the pages of futuristic fiction, the field of robotics promises to be the most profoundly disruptive technological shift since industrialisation. While robots have been utilised in the automotive and manufacturing sectors for decades, experts now predict an imminent tipping point in robotic usage across many sectors – and say that much of the industrialised world simply isn’t prepared for this radical transition. Many of us recognise robotic automation as an inevitably disruptive force. However, in a classic example of optimism bias, while approximately two-thirds of people believe that robots will inevitably perform most of the work currently done by humans during the next 50 years, about 80% also believe their current jobs will either ‘definitely‘ or ‘probably‘ exist in their current form within the same timeframe. Somehow, we believe our livelihoods will be safe. They’re not: every commercial sector will be affected by robotic automation in the next several years.\r\nFor example, Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has developed a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 standard bricks in one hour – a task that would take two human bricklayers the better part of a day or longer to complete. Two years ago, San Francisco-based startup Simbe Robotics unveiled Tally, a robot that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers during regular business hours and ensures not, as might be expected, that the aisles are free from grime and rubbish, but that goods are adequately stocked, placed and priced.\r\nAdvocates for robotic automation routinely highlight the fact that, for the most part, robots cannot service or program themselves – yet. In theory, this will create new, highly-skilled jobs for technicians and programmers and other well-paid roles. Critics, on the other hand, warn that we mustn’t overlook the value of interpersonal skills at work. They say that society is not prepared for the upheaval that the downgrading of the human touch will bring.\r\nFew people understand this tension better than world expert on the commercial applications of robotics technology, Dr Jing Bing Zhang. As research director for global marketing intelligence firm IDC, Zhang investigates the way in which robotics is shaping tomorrow’s working population. A recent report by Zhang and his team regarding general trends says that within two years almost one-third of robots will be smarter, more efficient robots, which are capable of collaborating with other robots and working safely alongside humans. Within three years, 30% or more of the world’s leading companies will have a designated chief robotics officer, and several governments around the world will have drafted or implemented specific legislation surrounding robots. Within five years, average salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60% – yet more than one-third of the available jobs in robotics will remain vacant due to shortages of skilled workers. ‘Automation and robotics will definitely impact lower-skilled people, which is unfortunate,’ Zhang told me via phone from his Singapore office. ‘I think the only way for them to move up or adapt is not to hope that the government will protect their jobs from technology, but look for ways to retrain themselves. No one can expect to do the same thing for life. That’s just not the case any more.’\r\nMeanwhile, developments in motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will inevitably give rise to an entirely new class of robots aimed predominantly at consumer markets – robots the likes of which we have never seen before. Upright, bipedal robots that live alongside us in our homes; robots that interact with us in increasingly sophisticated ways – in short, robots that were once the sole province of the realms of science fiction. This, according to Zhang, represents an unparalleled opportunity for companies positioned to take advantage of this shift. Yet it also poses significant challenges, such as the necessity for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.\r\nWith millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow. In an increasingly unstable employment market, developed nations desperately need more science, technology, engineering and maths – commonly abbreviated as STEM – graduates to remain competitive.\r\nIn the first paragraph, what does the writer acknowledge about the public’s perception of the use of robots?",
    "Answer_A": "They mistakenly believe it will have little effect on their employment prospects. ",
    "Answer_B": "They think that using robots is an appropriate practice in certain industry sectors.",

However, in a classic example of optimism bias, while approximately two-thirds of people believe that robots will inevitably perform most of the work currently done by humans during the next 50 years, about 80% also believe their current jobs will either ‘definitely‘ or ‘probably‘ exist in their current form within the same timeframe. Somehow, we believe our livelihoods will be safe. They’re not: every commercial sector will be affected by robotic automation in the next several years.\r\nFor example, Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has developed a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 standard bricks in one hour – a task that would take two human bricklayers the better part of a day or longer to complete. Two years ago, San Francisco-based startup Simbe Robotics unveiled Tally, a robot that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers during regular business hours and ensures not, as might be expected, that the aisles are free from grime and rubbish, but that goods are adequately stocked, placed and priced.\r\nAdvocates for robotic automation routinely highlight the fact that, for the most part, robots cannot service or program themselves – yet. In theory, this will create new, highly-skilled jobs for technicians and programmers and other well-paid roles. Critics, on the other hand, warn that we mustn’t overlook the value of interpersonal skills at work. They say that society is not prepared for the upheaval that the downgrading of the human touch will bring.\r\nFew people understand this tension better than world expert on the commercial applications of robotics technology, Dr Jing Bing Zhang. As research director for global marketing intelligence firm IDC, Zhang investigates the way in which robotics is shaping tomorrow’s working population. A recent report by Zhang and his team regarding general trends says that within two years almost one-third of robots will be smarter, more efficient robots, which are capable of collaborating with other robots and working safely alongside humans. Within three years, 30% or more of the world’s leading companies will have a designated chief robotics officer, and several governments around the world will have drafted or implemented specific legislation surrounding robots. Within five years, average salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60% – yet more than one-third of the available jobs in robotics will remain vacant due to shortages of skilled workers. ‘Automation and robotics will definitely impact lower-skilled people, which is unfortunate,’ Zhang told me via phone from his Singapore office. ‘I think the only way for them to move up or adapt is not to hope that the government will protect their jobs from technology, but look for ways to retrain themselves. No one can expect to do the same thing for life. That’s just not the case any more.’\r\nMeanwhile, developments in motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will inevitably give rise to an entirely new class of robots aimed predominantly at consumer markets – robots the likes of which we have never seen before. Upright, bipedal robots that live alongside us in our homes; robots that interact with us in increasingly sophisticated ways – in short, robots that were once the sole province of the realms of science fiction. This, according to Zhang, represents an unparalleled opportunity for companies positioned to take advantage of this shift. Yet it also poses significant challenges, such as the necessity for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.\r\nWith millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow. In an increasingly unstable employment market, developed nations desperately need more science, technology, engineering and maths – commonly abbreviated as STEM – graduates to remain competitive.\r\nIn the fifth paragraph, which of these words is used to convey the sense that something remarkable is occurring?",

    "Question": "‘Because it’s there,’ the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have responded to a reporter’s question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. The reporter, in forming his inquiry, was undoubtedly expressing a common sentiment: the general public has an unending desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams; it challenges a certain type of person to face the unknown. Yet its real merit lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.\r\nAn important essay on climbing is ‘Games that Climbers Play’, 1967, by the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven distinct climbing activities, or ‘games’, from playing around on boulders to scaling Himalayan peaks, each with its own set of rules. And he maintained that the style used to tackle any climb – for example, using more or less equipment – has to depend on the rules of that particular game. Over the intervening years, this approach to climbing has rightly come to dominate climbing discourse in the West as it is expressed in everything from climbing magazines to fire-side debates.\r\nFor many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom. \r\nWhen presented with the question ‘Why climb?’ the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction in his recent essay. Fitschen argues that a better question would be ‘Why do people climb?’ This way, Fitschen asks about our species and gives an evolutionary explanation for why we climb. Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits, even if there are risks involved. Thus the pleasures we get from climbing have more to do with biology than any rational process. \r\nAnother significant contribution was made in a recent essay by US academic Brian Treanor, who proposes that climbing helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. While Treanor acknowledges that these are not the only favourable characteristics that climbing has the potential to develop, and that not all climbers exhibit these virtues, he thinks developing these virtues is particularly important in our modernized and risk-averse world. Climbing, then, serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world. \r\nOne further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed. Expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson caused a degree of controversy by claiming it is because the climb is harder or riskier when done independently that such climbing achievements deserve greater recognition than those completed by large teams or aided by artificial means, such as bottled oxygen supplies at high altitude. The crux of the issue seems to have been that the essay may have encouraged some in the climbing fraternity to expose themselves to unnecessary dangers. \r\nIt is also possible to inquire into climbing by leaving the Western tradition. Being in the moment, in the zone, or going with the flow are all common experiences reported by climbers. The physical work involved on a climb, the active meditation while on a route and the problem solving that is intuitive rather than logical, are all fundamental parts of climbing. So much so that it has been argued that the discipline of climbing parallels many of the techniques used in Zen philosophy to train the mind towards reaching a state of perfect peace. In this, then, people may find one further idea to consider when asking why men and women are drawn to climbing.\r\nWhen discussing George Mallory’s comment, the writer expresses",

Yet its real merit lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.\r\nAn important essay on climbing is ‘Games that Climbers Play’, 1967, by the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven distinct climbing activities, or ‘games’, from playing around on boulders to scaling Himalayan peaks, each with its own set of rules. And he maintained that the style used to tackle any climb – for example, using more or less equipment – has to depend on the rules of that particular game. Over the intervening years, this approach to climbing has rightly come to dominate climbing discourse in the West as it is expressed in everything from climbing magazines to fire-side debates.\r\nFor many climbers, their love of climbing results from the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. Being pinned down by storms in a wind-whipped tent, for example, is far from our typical notion of liberation. There is, then, an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom. \r\nWhen presented with the question ‘Why climb?’ the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction in his recent essay. Fitschen argues that a better question would be ‘Why do people climb?’ This way, Fitschen asks about our species and gives an evolutionary explanation for why we climb. Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits, even if there are risks involved. Thus the pleasures we get from climbing have more to do with biology than any rational process. \r\nAnother significant contribution was made in a recent essay by US academic Brian Treanor, who proposes that climbing helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. While Treanor acknowledges that these are not the only favourable characteristics that climbing has the potential to develop, and that not all climbers exhibit these virtues, he thinks developing these virtues is particularly important in our modernized and risk-averse world. Climbing, then, serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world. \r\nOne further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed. Expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson caused a degree of controversy by claiming it is because the climb is harder or riskier when done independently that such climbing achievements deserve greater recognition than those completed by large teams or aided by artificial means, such as bottled oxygen supplies at high altitude.

    "Question": "Over six decades the pianist Alfred Brendel gradually built up and maintained a dominant position in the world of classical music. He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\r\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn’t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14. He listened to him play. Brendel explained, ‘He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note. It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\r\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\r\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing. One doesn’t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection’.\r\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains ‘When I was very young, I didn’t have the urge to be famous in five year’s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on. Although I do not have the physical power now, in my head, there are always things going on, all sorts of pieces that I’ve never played.

It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\r\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\r\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing. One doesn’t say that in a newspaper. And it has done a great deal of harm. As usual, with gifted young players, he can play certain things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic was there expecting the greatest perfection’.\r\nNow at the age of 80, it is touching to see the mellowness of Brendel in his post-performing years. He explains ‘When I was very young, I didn’t have the urge to be famous in five year’s time, but I had the idea I would like to have done certain things by the age of 50. And when I was 50, I thought that I had done most of those things, but there was still some leeway for more, so I went on. Although I do not have the physical power now, in my head, there are always things going on, all sorts of pieces that I’ve never played. I don’t play now but it’s a very nice new career.’\r\nWhy does the writer use the phrase ‘catches himself’ in line 51?",

    "Question": "Over six decades the pianist Alfred Brendel gradually built up and maintained a dominant position in the world of classical music. He was an intellectual, sometimes austere, figure who explored and recorded the mainstream European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.\r\nAnd then, four or five years ago, a young boy, Kit Armstrong, appeared backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn’t take the suggestion very seriously. He had had very few pupils and he saw no reason to start now. He quotes from another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something that struck him about the young boy – then about 14. He listened to him play. Brendel explained, ‘He played remarkably well and by heart. Then he brought me a CD of a little recital he had given where he played so beautifully that I thought to myself, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that really led you from the first to the last note. It’s very rare to find any musician with this kind of overview and the necessary subtlety.’\r\nAs Brendel is bowing out of the public eye, so Kit is nudging his way into it – restrained by Brendel, ever nervous about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is a restless, impatient presence away from the lessons – always learning new languages; taking himself off to study maths, writing computer code or playing tennis. All under the watchful eye of his ever-present mother. On top of all this he composes. ‘This was very important,’ Brendel says. ‘To learn to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. Then I noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and that he was a phenomenal sight reader. But more than this is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound and his ability to listen to me when I try to explain something. He not only usually understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes in later.’\r\nBrendel catches himself and looks severe. ‘Now I don’t want to raise any expectations. I’m very cross if some newspapers try to do this. There was one article which named him as the future great pianist of the 21st century, I mean, really, it’s like the worst thing.

    "Question": "Initially populated by computer scientists and the self-taught, the game design industry used not to offer many routes into its midst. Often, perhaps unfairly, viewed as just a hobby for young enthusiasts, the video games industry is now being taken seriously. Surprised? Industry experts aren’t.\r\nIt’s not easy though. Video game spin-offs that rapidly follow any new movie require dozens of team members and months of incredible skill, perseverance and intricacies. As with almost every industry, it’s tricky to get into – but it is expanding. Jim Donelly, a spokesman for an online games magazine says: ‘It’s certainly very difficult to make much headway within big companies, or to influence any of the really big mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.’\r\nSo, how can you get into such a competitive industry? Although many companies prefer people  to have a degree in computer science, Jim disagrees. ‘There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something, and you won’t get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff. Game design is less a job than it is a way of life. Like any creative endeavour it must be done to be real.’ Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s really more complicated than that. There are lots of people who want to work in games, but few who measure up to the requirements of the industry these days; even fewer who have the creative talent, technical know-how, vision and entrepreneurial ability to really contribute to the ever-changing face of an evolving medium.’\r\nCan you do it on your own? ‘Perhaps, but it’s pretty tricky,’ says John. ‘However, a good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. Most games designers start their careers as programmers, or artists, progressing their way up the ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment media, plus have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. They may or may not have spent a few years in the working world post-graduation, but have realised that games is going to be their “thing”. They are not merely fans, but are fascinated by the future possibilities of games, and are aware of the increasing breadth and diversity of the form. And finally connections can help. This is often overlooked, but in order to get ahead in games – as in many other areas – you need to network.’\r\nThe childish stereotype of the adolescent boy glued to his games console has long been replaced by the more accurate perception of a grown-up medium, grabbing our attention. Families frequently get involved on interactive consoles. Smart phones introduce a wealth of new games through apps, as well as social media. John believes there is plenty of room for expansion. ‘Games have become pervasive play-things for increasingly large audiences.

Not just director-level people who orchestrate an entire game, but the lower-level people who design systems and individual set pieces.’\r\nSo, how can you get into such a competitive industry? Although many companies prefer people  to have a degree in computer science, Jim disagrees. ‘There is only one route: make games. The tools are there. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something, and you won’t get anywhere independently if you are not making stuff. Game design is less a job than it is a way of life. Like any creative endeavour it must be done to be real.’ Another industry expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s really more complicated than that. There are lots of people who want to work in games, but few who measure up to the requirements of the industry these days; even fewer who have the creative talent, technical know-how, vision and entrepreneurial ability to really contribute to the ever-changing face of an evolving medium.’\r\nCan you do it on your own? ‘Perhaps, but it’s pretty tricky,’ says John. ‘However, a good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. Most games designers start their careers as programmers, or artists, progressing their way up the ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment media, plus have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. They may or may not have spent a few years in the working world post-graduation, but have realised that games is going to be their “thing”. They are not merely fans, but are fascinated by the future possibilities of games, and are aware of the increasing breadth and diversity of the form. And finally connections can help. This is often overlooked, but in order to get ahead in games – as in many other areas – you need to network.’\r\nThe childish stereotype of the adolescent boy glued to his games console has long been replaced by the more accurate perception of a grown-up medium, grabbing our attention. Families frequently get involved on interactive consoles. Smart phones introduce a wealth of new games through apps, as well as social media. John believes there is plenty of room for expansion. ‘Games have become pervasive play-things for increasingly large audiences. They are also a great way to learn things and I see this already big area as an expanding array of possibilities and opportunities.’\r\nIn the final paragraph, we are told that",

    "Question": "It was because of Sam Carter that we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\r\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile. But now, with the hot weather, the place flowered with people.\r\nAnd so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity. My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind. Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\r\nRusty was a dog. My dog. When we first moved to Reef Point we hadn’t got a dog, so Rusty decided to remedy this. Accordingly he hung around. I chased him off and he returned, unrepentant. One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force. Rusty knew this and moved in a little nearer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us’.\r\nYou’re wrong Jane,’ replied my father. ‘He thinks we belong to him.’\r\nRusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners. He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. You’d have thought he’d have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\r\nWe had been swimming that day. Father, the deadline met, had driven down to Los Angeles to deliver the script in person, and Rusty and I had kept each other company in and out of the sea all afternoon. But now, the setting sun gold, it was getting cooler and we sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. They chose a wave and stood, a poem of balance, as the water curved up, riding the wave until it swept onto the sand.\r\nOne surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs. But now she seemed to decide to call it a day and rode in on a final wave.\r\nHi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’\r\n‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’\r\n‘You could get one.’\r\n‘No money.’\r\n‘You’re British, aren’t you? You visiting?’\r\n‘No I live here.’\r\n‘Is your father American?’\r\n‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he had written.’\r\n‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’\r\n‘Rufus Marsh.’\r\n‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that cover to cover’ She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. They were friendly but never interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning.\r\nWhy did Sam Carter find the house at Reef Point for the screenwriter and his daughter?",

Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles, and it was in sheer desperation that he eventually offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live, because Los Angeles and my father were so acutely antipathetic that not one sellable word was he able to write while we lived there, and Sam was in danger of losing both valuable clients and money.\r\nThrough the summer, the beach had been deserted since, as so often happens, the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. For one thing, the road was uninviting. For another, the charming little resort of La Carmella, lay just over the point, and anyone with any sense and a few dollars to spare, stayed put right there. Only if you were broke, or surfing mad, did you risk the last mile. But now, with the hot weather, the place flowered with people.\r\nAnd so after months of being virtually on our own, we were surrounded by people and every sort of activity. My father was hard at work every day trying to write a script to a deadline, and in an impossible frame of mind. Unnoticed by him, most days I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company.\r\nRusty was a dog. My dog. When we first moved to Reef Point we hadn’t got a dog, so Rusty decided to remedy this. Accordingly he hung around. I chased him off and he returned, unrepentant. One morning, taking pity on him, I gave him a bowl of cool water to drink. My father threw a boot at him, but without enthusiasm. It was simply a half-hearted show of force. Rusty knew this and moved in a little nearer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you suppose he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us’.\r\nYou’re wrong Jane,’ replied my father. ‘He thinks we belong to him.’\r\nRusty loved the beach, and was forever digging things up and bringing them to me. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. These I had to return to their anxious owners. He liked to swim too, and always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. You’d have thought he’d have got discouraged but (luckily) he never did.\r\nWe had been swimming that day. Father, the deadline met, had driven down to Los Angeles to deliver the script in person, and Rusty and I had kept each other company in and out of the sea all afternoon. But now, the setting sun gold, it was getting cooler and we sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. They chose a wave and stood, a poem of balance, as the water curved up, riding the wave until it swept onto the sand.\r\nOne surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs. But now she seemed to decide to call it a day and rode in on a final wave.\r\nHi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’\r\n‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’\r\n‘You could get one.’\r\n‘No money.’\r\n‘You’re British, aren’t you? You visiting?’\r\n‘No I live here.’\r\n‘Is your father American?’\r\n‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he had written.’\r\n‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’\r\n‘Rufus Marsh.’\r\n‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that cover to cover’ She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. They were friendly but never interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning.\r\nWhat does the conversation with the surfer reveal about Jane?",
    "Answer_A": "She was nervous every time she spoke to someone she had never met before.",
    "Answer_B": "She was ashamed to admit she didn’t have a surfboard.",
    "Answer_C": "She was surprised that the girl had read one of her father’s books.",

    "Question": "‘What on earth have I done?’ Violet Hetherington asked herself.\r\nShe was standing in one of several queues in the dock at Southampton. The queues, by now spilling out of the cattle shed marked ‘Departures’, to board the Queen Caroline where long and none was moving. ‘It’s best to get to the docks late’, her friend Annie had advised. ‘If you get there too early you can grow roots hanging about.’ Annie, married to a diplomat and full of advice, was a seasoned traveller. But on this occasion her advice was mistaken.\r\nAfter a while an announcement came through the loudspeakers: there had been a ‘breakdown in the computer system.’ In the face of this setback the atmosphere among the waiting passengers darkened. Some attempted patience, some brave souls even tried to rise to jollity but for the most part the mood became rebellious. They had paid good money – through the nose, many were inclined to feel – for this voyage. This might be their last chance for a bit of luxury. That they could not even be got aboard efficiently did not promise well.\r\nViolet’s own instinct was to turn tail. She felt in her bag for her phone and discovered that it was missing. This was a good deal more annoying than the length of the queues. It confirmed an uneasy sense that the whole idea of a cruise was one of her mistakes. And now there was the nuisance of the phone. She couldn’t ring the minicab company to check whether she had left it in the taxi, because that number – along with all her other numbers – was stored in her phone. The very error that her elder son Harry was always  counselling her to avoid.\r\nBehind her in the queue, stood an approachable-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry but, stupidly, I seem to have left my mobile phone behind. I couldn’t borrow yours to make one call, could I?’ Violet rang Harry on the obliging couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbour, if she would check to see whether the phone had been left behind. It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them. Dan might easily forget to give the message to Kristina at all.\r\nEventually the queues started to move forward and Violet was ushered towards a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to go aboard. Her heart sank further in the ship’s foyer which resembled one of the not-so-grand hotels that have set their sights too high. There were panels of shining fake walnut, extravagant cascades of chandeliers, polished brass plating and carpets patterned in the style commonly found at airports.\r\nViolet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’ which were lined floor to ceiling with mirrors and crammed with passengers who, bedraggled from early morning starts, luggage disposal and the incurable anxiety induced by travel arrangements, might have preferred to be spared the sight of their multiple reflections. Violet was squashed against the side of the lift as it moved upward, stopping at each floor to release a tide of thankful prisoners. But, at last, at the twelfth floor, she stepped out to freedom.\r\nAnd, thank heavens, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been anxiously rehearsing what to say if it had not. Ignoring Annie’s suggestion that she wait for a last minute deal, she had thrown caution to the winds and paid the highest price she could afford in order to be sure of the sea.\r\nIn the first paragraph what do we learn about how Violet felt?",

I couldn’t borrow yours to make one call, could I?’ Violet rang Harry on the obliging couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbour, if she would check to see whether the phone had been left behind. It is was not in her flat she was going to be in trouble, since she had no other means of finding numbers she needed in New York. A large part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not confide this to Harry. Harry had come to the view early in life that if not older than his mother he was a good deal more worldly wise. Daniel, her younger son, was far more sympathetic to her faults but that was because he shared them.

    "Question": "Alice Leader was standing in front of the remains of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an extraordinary feat of engineering it was by the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 metres high back around 1900 years ago. She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \r\nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she’d taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn’t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I’m still in touch with children through the fiction.’\r\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s fiction for children. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she is quick to add, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’\r\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is spurred on by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It’s all down to me to make it work at that point.’\r\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was finally inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the seeds lay in the prospect of the ‘empty nest’ approaching as her two sons were leaving home, and an unexpected recommendation from her head teacher that she would enjoy a residential creative writing course. Alice was taken aback. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn’t think was necessary.’\r\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analysed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \r\nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his assistance in editing the novel was key. Says Alice, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene. That’s  the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’\r\nWhy was Alice not satisfied when she took her students to a famous ancient wall?",

My books are neither.’\r\nAlice always tried to teach English and History as closely related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is spurred on by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when the child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because the game is on then. It’s all down to me to make it work at that point.’\r\nShe sees her writing as an extension of teaching.

But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course that I didn’t think was necessary.’\r\nBefore she was accepted on the course she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a stipulation she became aware of only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analysed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off in order to write her first novel. \r\nIt helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his assistance in editing the novel was key. Says Alice, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working he suggests changing the words.

    "Question": "Alice Leader was standing in front of the remains of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an extraordinary feat of engineering it was by the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 metres high back around 1900 years ago. She had already stimulated their interest, since the group had chosen this trip above glamorous tours to Spain, Greece or France. But what they really wanted to know was why it was built. And Alice felt her answers were unsatisfactory. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she resolved to write one herself. \r\nHaving retired from teaching after 31 years in the classroom, Alice embarked on a second career as an author in 2001. After a very successful teaching career, Alice felt she’d taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but the process isn’t so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me, because I’m still in touch with children through the fiction.’\r\nAlice says her main ambition for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s fiction for children. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she is quick to add, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or alternatively there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter.

    "Question": "To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, champion triathletes, to take part in a unique race that would set man against car, and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\r\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’\r\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start. Barely time for a quick handshake and they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across country to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\r\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\r\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\r\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car – and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\r\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ The head went back, the arms up. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car pulled up and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said with disappointment. ‘I’m gutted.’\r\nThe writer explains that before the race the brothers were alike in ",

The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?\r\nJonny’s early confidence took an immediate blow. Barely 15 seconds into the drive and he faced his first obstacle. Lumbering out of a field and into the road was a giant tractor. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ Tense moments later, the tractor safely dealt with, Jonny was back in control, coasting into the morning mist.\r\nAlistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in and, as his brother relaxed, he was forced to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep gazed, as the Olympic champion kept up a steady pace, at the bizarre sight of a man in a field with a bike on his shoulders. And then, finally, the summit was reached. Over the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out and the land spread before him, a chance to show what he was made of. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed.\r\nIn the car, his brother faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have stood since well before the invention of the car – and the roads that link them were not exactly made for speed. Jonny attempted to negotiate another absurdly narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream that had formed on the road.\r\nClear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finishing line.  Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny roared the engine and sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back on to the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ The head went back, the arms up. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car pulled up and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said with disappointment. ‘I’m gutted.’\r\nWhat does ‘Bemused’ mean in line 24?",

    "Question": "To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, champion triathletes, to take part in a unique race that would set man against car, and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and younger brother Ali would race to the same point, Jonny in a car on roads, Ali across country on a mountain bike.\r\n‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers took their places on the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was similarly eager – though in contrast to Jonny’s jeans and sweatshirt, he was decked out in full winter cycling gear. Not that the cold was denting his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’\r\nThe race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, some 350 metres up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start.

    "Question": "Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways.\r\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That’s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn’t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’\r\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears. I think I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was very fair. I’d forgotten all about my dad’s annoying habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. How Dad would have laughed to hear about this strange series of events!\r\nMy mum and dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar: it was the 1970s and classical guitarists were very popular. I loved the sound of the instrument: so calming, so gentle – and so flattering to the learner. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound awful in the hands of a beginner. But the truth was, I couldn’t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. This was not just the era of the classical guitar; it was also the time of punk music, when people who  weren’t able to play their instruments well could be rock stars.\r\nWhen I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith had sent to me, I had a sudden, vivid memory of my birthday, back in 1978, when my smiling parents presented the instrument to me. Picking it up again, it felt so fascinatingly smooth, dense, yet smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then instantly felt the need to stand up, putting a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar demands to be played in this position. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it. My middle-aged, fleshy fingertips felt that special pain of holding down the wires to play a chord.\r\nThe electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I guess I’ll have to form a band. My son’s learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves \r\n‘The Regainers’!\r\nWhat does the writer suggest about his decision to throw his electric guitar away?",
    "Answer_A": "He still cannot explain it.",

    "Question": "Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Why, when I loathe getting rid of even useless old stuff, did I want to throw something like that away? Anyway, I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put this precious object on a pile of rubbish, when a young man with a frown on his face came up to me, understandably baffled. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he said. I said that I was, already feeling the first twinges of regret. He asked if he could have it; I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways.\r\nIn the days and years that followed, I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. And then a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I vaguely remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he sits down to eat fish at a local restaurant, cuts open the fish and there it is. That’s how I felt when I clicked on this email from someone I didn’t know, a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. What he said to me was: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’\r\nEvidently, it had been bought and sold several times since the guy from the dump had relieved me of it.  Keith had found a name-and-address label on the back. He correctly realised this was probably out of date, but used my name to locate me online.  Eventually he managed to contact me via the newspaper I work for and was offering to sell it back to me. It was all I could do not to burst into tears.

    "Question": "During her racing days, nothing mattered more to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, unless it was being the fastest person on its surface. It was her great obsession from childhood. With the boats that took her round the world, she had a kind of strange union. They worked as one. And when she was on land again, everyday life felt trivial, everyone pressed in too much to find out about the race, and she soon wanted to be out on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature even in places that had nearly destroyed her.\r\nAfter she came second in the Vendée Globe non stop, solo round-the-world race several years ago, she took me down into the tiny, unventilated cabin of her boat Kingfisher on a ‘tour’ of what had been her cell, home, work station and survival-capsule for 94 days. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning; how she worked out, to the last sheet, exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was everything, she said. Proudly, she showed off her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, the tiny gas stove, the neatly hanging polythene bags of medical necessities and rations. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. \r\nNow, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, a desolate island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space … to see things differently; to realise things I hadn’t let into my head before.’ The sight of so many abandoned whaling stations struck her as a warning. ‘It seemed as though we had just taken what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.’\r\nWhen I arrive at Ellen’s office she is just finishing off a heated conference call. Then she explains to me why action must be taken now to save the planet. ‘No one is making coal or oil or gas any more. They are a precious asset we have just once. We have to design a way of not using things up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but gradually I realised there was another way of looking at things.’ Now she emphasises re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.\r\n For the last three years, she has been touring factories, mines and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she says. ‘But I am a bit like a sponge. I love soaking things up. [The current situation] became something I just couldn’t ignore. Sailing, by comparison, seemed incredibly selfish. This is different. It’s about trying to find out how my voice can be the most useful. It really matters.’\r\nShe also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure that comes from being at sea,’ she says. ‘It is what makes me, me.

    "Question": "During her racing days, nothing mattered more to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, unless it was being the fastest person on its surface. It was her great obsession from childhood. With the boats that took her round the world, she had a kind of strange union. They worked as one. And when she was on land again, everyday life felt trivial, everyone pressed in too much to find out about the race, and she soon wanted to be out on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature even in places that had nearly destroyed her.\r\nAfter she came second in the Vendée Globe non stop, solo round-the-world race several years ago, she took me down into the tiny, unventilated cabin of her boat Kingfisher on a ‘tour’ of what had been her cell, home, work station and survival-capsule for 94 days. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning; how she worked out, to the last sheet, exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was everything, she said. Proudly, she showed off her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, the tiny gas stove, the neatly hanging polythene bags of medical necessities and rations. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. \r\nNow, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, a desolate island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space … to see things differently; to realise things I hadn’t let into my head before.’ The sight of so many abandoned whaling stations struck her as a warning. ‘It seemed as though we had just taken what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.’\r\nWhen I arrive at Ellen’s office she is just finishing off a heated conference call. Then she explains to me why action must be taken now to save the planet. ‘No one is making coal or oil or gas any more. They are a precious asset we have just once. We have to design a way of not using things up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but gradually I realised there was another way of looking at things.’ Now she emphasises re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.\r\n For the last three years, she has been touring factories, mines and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she says. ‘But I am a bit like a sponge. I love soaking things up. [The current situation] became something I just couldn’t ignore. Sailing, by comparison, seemed incredibly selfish. This is different. It’s about trying to find out how my voice can be the most useful. It really matters.’\r\nShe also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure that comes from being at sea,’ she says. ‘It is what makes me, me. You are so connected to everything around you. You have no time to get lonely. You are focused on the record, on practicalities, on survival. [My new] message will never be as straightforward as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest person round the world.” I may have been the fastest round the world, but this beats everything I’ve ever done.’\r\nIn the last paragraph, Ellen admits that",

    "Question": "When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be pretty certain it’s not classical music they’re listening to.  Most of us can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and you can tell by the expression on their face that they haven’t a clue.  I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age.  And if you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work.\r\nThe statistics must be depressing for a lover of classical music.  Apparently only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere 300 copies.  I must say I still find that hard to believe.  So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries?  The older generation are irritated by our obsession with TV and video games, blaming it for most things, but I don’t think there is any connection in this case.  The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets.\r\nNow, I’m aware that this doesn’t apply to everyone my age.  I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts all the time, but they are a minority.  Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not exactly a classical music fan.  I enjoy a huge range of styles, but judging by what’s stored on my computer, my classical music consumption is probably pretty close to that 3% figure.\r\nSo why don’t teenagers like classical music?  Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its numerous changes of mood, are problematic for us.  We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast.  In addition, if you believe the experts, we have difficulty paying attention for more than about three minutes; far too short for most pieces of classical music, but perfect for a pop song.  Pop is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to, while appreciating a piece of classical music requires time and concentration.  The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics.  Classical music is incredibly powerful, but not exactly full of the issues that concern teenagers.\r\nThe way we listen to music has also changed.  In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and an ability to play an instrument was highly valued.  The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert.  Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.  When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing in the background?\r\nOne of my teachers claims that audiences at classical concerts have actually increased in recent years.  Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers.  In my orchestra we play classical music in all sorts of different places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see virtually nothing but grey hair when I look into the crowd.  I don’t know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your mum and dad love something, the chances are you’ll do your best to stay away from it.\r\nSome say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra.  They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse.  Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice.  The two activities have become separated.  When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.\r\nIn the first paragraph, what does the writer say about teenagers?",
    "Answer_A": "Their knowledge of classical music is limited to the names of composers.",
    "Answer_B": "They don’t listen to classical music because they don’t know what to buy.",

    "Question": "When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be pretty certain it’s not classical music they’re listening to.  Most of us can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and you can tell by the expression on their face that they haven’t a clue.  I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age.  And if you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work.\r\nThe statistics must be depressing for a lover of classical music.  Apparently only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere 300 copies.  I must say I still find that hard to believe.  So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries?  The older generation are irritated by our obsession with TV and video games, blaming it for most things, but I don’t think there is any connection in this case.  The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets.\r\nNow, I’m aware that this doesn’t apply to everyone my age.  I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts all the time, but they are a minority.  Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not exactly a classical music fan.  I enjoy a huge range of styles, but judging by what’s stored on my computer, my classical music consumption is probably pretty close to that 3% figure.\r\nSo why don’t teenagers like classical music?  Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its numerous changes of mood, are problematic for us.  We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast.  In addition, if you believe the experts, we have difficulty paying attention for more than about three minutes; far too short for most pieces of classical music, but perfect for a pop song.  Pop is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to, while appreciating a piece of classical music requires time and concentration.  The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics.  Classical music is incredibly powerful, but not exactly full of the issues that concern teenagers.\r\nThe way we listen to music has also changed.  In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and an ability to play an instrument was highly valued.  The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert.  Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.  When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing in the background?\r\nOne of my teachers claims that audiences at classical concerts have actually increased in recent years.  Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers.  In my orchestra we play classical music in all sorts of different places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see virtually nothing but grey hair when I look into the crowd.  I don’t know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your mum and dad love something, the chances are you’ll do your best to stay away from it.\r\nSome say that the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but there are plenty of kids eager to play classical music in their school orchestra.  They arrive early to practise and stay after school to rehearse.  Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise it is not their music of choice.  The two activities have become separated.  When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.\r\nWhat is the writer’s main point in the last paragraph?",
    "Answer_A": "Pop music is generally more relaxing to listen to than classical music.",
    "Answer_B": "Those who play classical music often don’t like listening to it.",
    "Answer_C": "Good classical musicians usually have to spend a lot of time practising.",

    "Question": "When I woke up this morning, I didn’t mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet.  Not that I’m claiming it was an accident, exactly, though it could have been.  Like if I’d tripped over the edge of the bed, for instance, with Dad’s Stanley knife clutched in my hand, the blade might well have gone plunging into the carpet all by itself and carved a huge great chunk out of it.  I mean, that is what could quite easily have happened.  I’m not saying that it did, just that it could have. \r\nAll I’m saying is, I didn’t mean to damage the carpet.  It wasn’t like I woke up in the morning and thought, ‘Today I shall cut a hole in my carpet.’  It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do.  Then afterwards you wonder why you thought that, only by then it’s too late.  This is something that happens to me rather a lot.  I’m very unfortunate in that way. \r\nWhat I was doing, in actual fact, wasn’t thinking about cutting holes so much as trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner.  Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat.  It’s really cute!  Very small and painted white, with pink and blue flowers all running round the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors.  Gran used to keep china ornaments in there:  shepherdesses and milkmaids and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons.  I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.  Gran knew I’d always loved her corner cabinet.  I was so excited when she gave it to me!  But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet.  That is why it is shaped like a triangle.  It has to stand in a corner. \r\nI’ve only got two corners in my bedroom.  This is because it’s the smallest room in the house, tucked away under the roof, and is shaped like a wedge of cheese.  The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the one the size of a broom cupboard belongs to me.  Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his.  And when Tom goes to University, I can take my pick.  But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems to me I’m going to be stuck in my broom cupboard for years to come.  I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom.  It’s cosy, like a nest.  And I love the way the roof slopes down, and the way the window is at floor level.  \r\nThe only problem is, the lack of corners!  My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.  I’d tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall.  If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...  That was when it came to me.  If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet?

I mean, that is what could quite easily have happened.  I’m not saying that it did, just that it could have. \r\nAll I’m saying is, I didn’t mean to damage the carpet.  It wasn’t like I woke up in the morning and thought, ‘Today I shall cut a hole in my carpet.’  It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do.  Then afterwards you wonder why you thought that, only by then it’s too late.  This is something that happens to me rather a lot.  I’m very unfortunate in that way. \r\nWhat I was doing, in actual fact, wasn’t thinking about cutting holes so much as trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner.  Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat.  It’s really cute!  Very small and painted white, with pink and blue flowers all running round the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors.  Gran used to keep china ornaments in there:  shepherdesses and milkmaids and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons.  I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.  Gran knew I’d always loved her corner cabinet.  I was so excited when she gave it to me!  But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet.  That is why it is shaped like a triangle.  It has to stand in a corner. \r\nI’ve only got two corners in my bedroom.  This is because it’s the smallest room in the house, tucked away under the roof, and is shaped like a wedge of cheese.  The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the one the size of a broom cupboard belongs to me.  Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his.  And when Tom goes to University, I can take my pick.  But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems to me I’m going to be stuck in my broom cupboard for years to come.  I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom.  It’s cosy, like a nest.  And I love the way the roof slopes down, and the way the window is at floor level.  \r\nThe only problem is, the lack of corners!  My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.  I’d tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall.  If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...  That was when it came to me.  If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet?  It just seemed like the obvious solution.  What Dad calls lateral thinking.  I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me.  He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’.  And that was exactly what I was doing!\r\nIn the text as a whole, what impression are we given of the writer?",

    "Question": "Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the Student Council president, but she must also have a part-time job, volunteer and, needless to say, she must excel in all of these fields. That's being an American teenager today. Teenage boys and girls can't simply go to school and blend into the background, because average is no longer enough. Mediocrity isn't acceptable and a lack of excessive ambition is considered laziness.\r\n‘People, often adults, forget how much pressure that teenagers have these days. We have piles of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores and responsibilities at home, all in addition to trying to maintain some sort of social life,’ teenager Kristen Loose says. Despite these stresses being the norm in teenage life today, the negative stereotypes of teenagers still exist, often perpetuated by people in the media. You know what I mean: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless and self-absorbed. While there is evidence that they do exist, lumping the entire generation into such a category is not considered fair by some. ‘A lot of people would assume that we spend the majority of our time with our eyes glued to the television and our hands glued to our cell phones,’ Loose says.\r\nLoose believes this assumption is largely incorrect. She admits to having her cellphone within a few feet at most times of the day, but not for frivolous purposes. It isn't just a means of texting her friends; it is a tool that teens have embraced to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. It is expected that students today have immediate access to the world and that they be reachable at all times, hence creating what appears to be a cell phone addiction. \r\nWith the introduction of smart phones, tablets and social media, students can now take their work on the go with them, and do their homework wherever they happen to be. Instead of listening to music on\t\tthe drive to school, they could be listening to downloaded language lessons. In essence, schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate, but now require 24-hour attention from already overworked teens. \r\nMany teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after school activities, family obligations and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation polled American teenagers and found that about 20 percent of all teens get the recommended nine hours a night. Moreover, 28 percent of teens polled admitted falling asleep in school about once a week, because of sleep deprivation.\r\nTeenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all of her other activities are accounted for, she gets about 18 hours of leisure time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is anything but impressive. And Olsen rarely wastes those hours on social media or television. Instead, she focuses much of her energy on volunteer work. ‘I think that the stereotype of teenagers is that they have a narrow view of the world, that their only focus is on themselves and their own personal and immediate interests,’ Olsen says.\r\nDespite that image of selfish teens, Olsen says that her favorite part of the week is the time she spends volunteering. ‘I have a heart for serving others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and wider community during the week.’ \r\nIn 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but without a doubt, they will still be proving it wrong and forcing the world forward. There will be another generation of students who are taking the world by storm, all before they leave school.\r\nWhat point is made about teenagers in the US in the first paragraph?",

This schedule is crammed with school, after school activities, family obligations and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation polled American teenagers and found that about 20 percent of all teens get the recommended nine hours a night. Moreover, 28 percent of teens polled admitted falling asleep in school about once a week, because of sleep deprivation.\r\nTeenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all of her other activities are accounted for, she gets about 18 hours of leisure time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is anything but impressive. And Olsen rarely wastes those hours on social media or television. Instead, she focuses much of her energy on volunteer work. ‘I think that the stereotype of teenagers is that they have a narrow view of the world, that their only focus is on themselves and their own personal and immediate interests,’ Olsen says.\r\nDespite that image of selfish teens, Olsen says that her favorite part of the week is the time she spends volunteering. ‘I have a heart for serving others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and wider community during the week.’ \r\nIn 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but without a doubt, they will still be proving it wrong and forcing the world forward. There will be another generation of students who are taking the world by storm, all before they leave school.\r\nIn the text as a whole, what view is the writer expressing?",

    "Answer_B": "Many people have a mistaken impression of what teenagers are really like.",

    "Question": "Chloe Morgan readily admits science, let alone Palaeontology, hadn’t held too much appeal for her, at least not until she was fifteen. Even then, it happened more by accident than design. ‘My younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase that’s so common among children, and which I hadn’t experienced. In fact, I tended to dismiss it. I reluctantly lent him a hand with a science project, and when I came across an article about some of the recent discoveries in the field, it just blew my mind. I knew immediately that this was something I wanted to commit myself to.’ \r\nI am curious to know what encouragement she got because Palaeontology was by no means a common career choice for young people at that time. ‘I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,’ she laughs. ‘This guy, Matt Cornelius, was famous already, despite being quite young. At first I was a nervous wreck, even though he had a reputation for being approachable and easy-going. I was still worried he’d think I was just an annoying kid pestering him with my questions. The whole thing could easily have been awkward and embarrassing,’ Chloe tells me. ‘But I felt more at ease when he showed so much patience and willingness to listen.’ \r\nI cannot resist bringing up the question of the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowns for a moment. ‘I have to admit that films such as Jurassic Park featuring dinosaurs created by special effects technology have led to a huge surge in public interest in these creatures, though not necessarily in Palaeontology more generally. However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading. What irritates me is that we're either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or rather geeky losers, figures of fun who don’t know how to relate to people. And films fail to represent accurately the everyday reality of our working lives.’ I ask her to explain.\r\n‘My job is remarkably varied. I spend lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also have to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications.’ \r\nWhile it's not necessarily something Chloe is required to do on a daily basis, there’s also the question of communicating scientific findings to the public, if time allows. The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. ‘There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don’t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it’s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.’ \r\nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. ‘I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period. We succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because we’ve learned such a tremendous amount about dinosaurs recently and the ones which are depicted in this programme are radically different to those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are easily the most life-like that have ever been portrayed.’ \r\nWhy does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain the focus of ongoing research?  ‘I suspect that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered. And Palaeontology is a great form of time travel.’\r\nChloe says she became seriously interested in Palaeontology because",

Chloe frowns for a moment. ‘I have to admit that films such as Jurassic Park featuring dinosaurs created by special effects technology have led to a huge surge in public interest in these creatures, though not necessarily in Palaeontology more generally. However much I welcome this, I think the relatively few examples of palaeontologists depicted in the cinema are misleading. What irritates me is that we're either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or rather geeky losers, figures of fun who don’t know how to relate to people. And films fail to represent accurately the everyday reality of our working lives.’ I ask her to explain.\r\n‘My job is remarkably varied. I spend lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also have to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications.’ \r\nWhile it's not necessarily something Chloe is required to do on a daily basis, there’s also the question of communicating scientific findings to the public, if time allows. The role of explaining and clarifying is one she takes seriously. ‘There are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions about science, and though I know colleagues who are reluctant to take on such a challenge and don’t want to be distracted from doing research, I see dealing with these issues as something I ought to do. I like to reach out to young people in particular, because it’s important to let them know about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs is one way to get children fired up about the natural world, and widen their horizons. They can start to appreciate other branches of science and to grasp more complex scientific ideas.’ \r\nThe recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She is quick to point out that the makers of the programme knew what they were doing and that she was there only to offer advice if required. ‘I had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that I needed to comment on, like dinosaurs that were too big or the wrong shape; it was mostly checking that the dinosaurs shown did exist together in the same time period. We succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because we’ve learned such a tremendous amount about dinosaurs recently and the ones which are depicted in this programme are radically different to those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are easily the most life-like that have ever been portrayed.’ \r\nWhy does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain the focus of ongoing research?  ‘I suspect that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered. And Palaeontology is a great form of time travel.’\r\nWhat does Chloe say about the TV the documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs ?",

    "Question": "Chloe Morgan readily admits science, let alone Palaeontology, hadn’t held too much appeal for her, at least not until she was fifteen. Even then, it happened more by accident than design. ‘My younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase that’s so common among children, and which I hadn’t experienced. In fact, I tended to dismiss it. I reluctantly lent him a hand with a science project, and when I came across an article about some of the recent discoveries in the field, it just blew my mind. I knew immediately that this was something I wanted to commit myself to.’ \r\nI am curious to know what encouragement she got because Palaeontology was by no means a common career choice for young people at that time. ‘I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,’ she laughs. ‘This guy, Matt Cornelius, was famous already, despite being quite young. At first I was a nervous wreck, even though he had a reputation for being approachable and easy-going. I was still worried he’d think I was just an annoying kid pestering him with my questions.

    "Question": "John and Zuzi Morgan have set up a café in Oxford, in the UK, where people can not only enjoy a cup of coffee and some cake, but play a board game too. The owners’ hope is that people enjoy the experience so much they want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a \r\nfull-time business: ‘There’s so much technology. Everybody’s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.’ The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's café are known as ‘Eurogames’. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building.\r\nThe first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan (later rebranded Catan), created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, keeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion, with none of the players feeling left out. That crucial factor was refined in the ‘co-operative' games that followed, in which every player wins or loses as a team member, provoking a lot more social interaction.\r\nPandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming’s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. ‘When I played that with friends we got scared,’ recalls Leacock. ‘There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.’\r\nLeacock’s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. ‘Games were my favourite birthday gift,’ he says, ‘but I’d get very excited, open up the box, then we’d play and there would just be crushing disappointment.’ So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards of the many games they played together and try to design something better using the same components.\r\nPandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design. It incorporates, Leacock explains, ‘a tremendous amount of storytelling. It’s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. It is an unfolding story.’\r\nThe growth of the video games industry has, perhaps contrary to expectations, been one of the biggest factors in the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games – largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing. ‘Video games and board games have learned an awful lot from each other,’ says Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company. ‘Everyone’s a mobile gamer now. Speak to anyone who’s got a smartphone, they’ve got at least one game they like to play on it. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.’\r\nFor a time, video-gaming offered a level of physical social interaction, at the arcade or through multi-player sofa games that friends or family members could play at the same time, in the same room. Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. So some people who had previously enjoyed playing video games started looking for a way of playing games again with other people who were physically present. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world and this trend is set to continue.\r\nWhat does Zuzi Morgan say about the board game café?",
    "Answer_A": "It satisfies a basic human need.",

We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.’ The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's café are known as ‘Eurogames’. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building.\r\nThe first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan (later rebranded Catan), created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, keeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion, with none of the players feeling left out. That crucial factor was refined in the ‘co-operative' games that followed, in which every player wins or loses as a team member, provoking a lot more social interaction.\r\nPandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock, one of tabletop gaming’s most successful designers. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the story and a collection of characters from the book of the same name. ‘When I played that with friends we got scared,’ recalls Leacock. ‘There were all sorts of highs and lows. At the end, everybody felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to see if I could do something like that.’\r\nLeacock’s passion for board games goes back to his experience of frustration with them as a child. ‘Games were my favourite birthday gift,’ he says, ‘but I’d get very excited, open up the box, then we’d play and there would just be crushing disappointment.’ So, with the help of a game-enthusiast uncle, young Leacock would flip over the boards of the many games they played together and try to design something better using the same components.\r\nPandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design. It incorporates, Leacock explains, ‘a tremendous amount of storytelling. It’s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. It is an unfolding story.’\r\nThe growth of the video games industry has, perhaps contrary to expectations, been one of the biggest factors in the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games – largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing. ‘Video games and board games have learned an awful lot from each other,’ says Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company. ‘Everyone’s a mobile gamer now. Speak to anyone who’s got a smartphone, they’ve got at least one game they like to play on it. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.’\r\nFor a time, video-gaming offered a level of physical social interaction, at the arcade or through multi-player sofa games that friends or family members could play at the same time, in the same room. Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. So some people who had previously enjoyed playing video games started looking for a way of playing games again with other people who were physically present. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world and this trend is set to continue.\r\nWhat point is made in the sixth paragraph about new types of board game?",

    "Question": "I work at a US university where my team and I are trying to learn more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. And we’ve just started using an exciting piece of equipment called a ‘night-vision scope’, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark! \r\nWe’re worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. There’s lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn.\r\nIt is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We’ve studied ducks in different locations, and I’ve had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. \r\nStill I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together.

Tasting the chocolate is an essential part of making sure that customers get perfect bars of high-quality chocolate from the company I work for.\r\nEvery week I receive samples, small amounts that show what the chocolate is like, from our factory and I have to check them for taste, texture and smell. I also have to taste the raw materials we usually use – the nuts, fruit and so on. I spend days choosing the most suitable ones to go into the chocolate. \r\nJust beside my company office I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make – and I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to play with. It’s wonderful to have a private space I can go off to during the day. \r\nNo two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab and others I’m out of the country buying our raw materials and, as I’ve got a young family, that can be difficult. But that kind of variety, and lack of routine, is something I love about the job, although I think it still comes second to the chocolate itself! The question I get asked most is whether I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt I didn’t want to eat it. In fact, I’ll often go home and eat some more in the evening!\r\nWhich one would be an advert for the chocolate company James works for?",
    "Answer_A": "Every single bar of chocolate that leaves our factory is tested for its taste.",
    "Answer_B": "We choose only the best ingredients – just chocolate beans, sugar and milk. We don’t add anything else.",

    "Question": "Starting out with only basic fashion knowledge, Julie Deane has created a successful business with her ‘satchels’  - a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. These satchels now sell in world-famous shops, and are the bag chosen by many celebrities. \r\nBefore choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses, from cake decorating to party planning, considering her options, rather than going with her first idea. Once she’d decided, she found not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, ‘Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.’ She involved family from the start, working with her mother, who’d never had a career, but has a natural business ability, and the design came from children’s story books.\r\nAlthough Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, they’ve been important to her success.

    "Question": "My city has a typical modern cinema showing all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s around the corner from where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club! \r\nWe decided early on that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films in. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we hired an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was freezing cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which means we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit.\r\nEach time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us, especially now we’ve got our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more concerns about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. \r\nThe website’s been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country.

    "Question": "When Janine Stuart was only 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which went on to become a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview about her book, Janine said, ‘Because of my father’s job, my family’s moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book focus on Amelia’s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother. As I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.’\r\nJanine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize.

    "Question": "When Janine Stuart was only 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which went on to become a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s life.

    "Question": "Everyone knows that sports teams enjoy a big advantage whenever they play at home.  But does anyone know why?  Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious.  But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.  Two driving forces have served to question whether traditional wisdom can be relied on when it comes to explaining home advantage: science and money.  Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform to their full potential and in so doing they have raised myriad theories on the impact of home advantage.  Meanwhile, the moneymen want to know why home advantage should still matter at all.  If they are paid enough surely the players should feel comfortable anywhere?\r\nSo where does all this leave the fans?  Would it matter say, if Manchester United were to play some of their home games in the Far East so as to catch their fan base there?  It would to the British home fans, who believe that their team need their passion and their loyal commitment to the cause, which may be why they confuse cause and effect.  It is human nature to imagine that a sequence of events is best explained by the order in which we remember them rather than the order in which they happened.  When a team go forward, the home support gets to its feet and starts to generate more noise; every now and then, one of these forward moves results in a goal, and the crowd sound explodes.  What fans tend to remember is that when they began to holler, scream and shout, a goal was scored.  What they omit are the countless times when the noise fizzled out because the move did not succeed.\r\nHowever, there is one conventional fan’s-eye view that does seem to be confirmed by the scientific evidence.  As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.  In a now famous experiment, a sample of referees was exposed to a recording of a match, with half watching with all the crowd effects and half watching a silent version.  The researchers found that the referees who heard the version with sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team than the ones who saw the game in silence (though, interestingly, the baying of the home crowd did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team).  This coincided with the actual decisions of the match official on the day.  The researchers concluded that referees shield themselves from extra stress that would be caused by making calls against the home team.  It’s not that the officials do what the crowd wants; they just try not to do whatever would direct the crowd’s fury straight at them.\r\nRecent studies of home advantage have analysed long-term historical trends.  They reveal that home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.  For instance, during the earliest years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70 per cent of the points on offer, compared to 60 per cent today.  One reason for this may well be travel, which used to be a laborious business; these days, football virtuosos are ferried around in unimaginable luxury and, if the hotel room isn’t good enough, someone from the club is at hand to find them another.  Local conditions were more likely to vary wildly but now the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency.  And yet, plausible as all these explanations are, none of them really fits the data.  These changes – cosseted stars, modern-day man servants, identikit stadiums (and also bringing in professional arbitrators) – all happened relatively recently, in the past decade or two.\r\nThe enduring mystery is why home advantage should vary depending on the sport.  Basketball is the game where playing at home is most advantageous, closely followed by football.  But baseball remains the sport where home advantage counts for least.  One possible explanation may be that home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in baseball there may be less team spirit since it is more about individual confrontations between batter and pitcher.  Team sports are about co-ordinating with your team mates.  In a sport such as basketball, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court.  It is this confidence that seems to be boosted by the familiarity of playing at home, regardless of any differences in the playing conditions.\r\nThere is a further possibility, one that connects to the darker side of sport.  Researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were average before training sessions and away matches, but were up to 67 per cent higher before home matches.  This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers such as in the recent Rugby World Cup.  There were two classic games in which the underdogs, playing at home, triumphed against better-fancied opposition, using grit, channelled aggression and a seemingly unquenchable refusal to be intimidated – this had all the hallmarks of home advantage.

When a team go forward, the home support gets to its feet and starts to generate more noise; every now and then, one of these forward moves results in a goal, and the crowd sound explodes.  What fans tend to remember is that when they began to holler, scream and shout, a goal was scored.  What they omit are the countless times when the noise fizzled out because the move did not succeed.\r\nHowever, there is one conventional fan’s-eye view that does seem to be confirmed by the scientific evidence.  As well as trying to roar the players on, home fans direct much of their vocal effort at the referee.  In a now famous experiment, a sample of referees was exposed to a recording of a match, with half watching with all the crowd effects and half watching a silent version.  The researchers found that the referees who heard the version with sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team than the ones who saw the game in silence (though, interestingly, the baying of the home crowd did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team).  This coincided with the actual decisions of the match official on the day.  The researchers concluded that referees shield themselves from extra stress that would be caused by making calls against the home team.  It’s not that the officials do what the crowd wants; they just try not to do whatever would direct the crowd’s fury straight at them.\r\nRecent studies of home advantage have analysed long-term historical trends.  They reveal that home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.  For instance, during the earliest years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70 per cent of the points on offer, compared to 60 per cent today.  One reason for this may well be travel, which used to be a laborious business; these days, football virtuosos are ferried around in unimaginable luxury and, if the hotel room isn’t good enough, someone from the club is at hand to find them another.  Local conditions were more likely to vary wildly but now the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency.  And yet, plausible as all these explanations are, none of them really fits the data.  These changes – cosseted stars, modern-day man servants, identikit stadiums (and also bringing in professional arbitrators) – all happened relatively recently, in the past decade or two.\r\nThe enduring mystery is why home advantage should vary depending on the sport.  Basketball is the game where playing at home is most advantageous, closely followed by football.  But baseball remains the sport where home advantage counts for least.  One possible explanation may be that home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in baseball there may be less team spirit since it is more about individual confrontations between batter and pitcher.  Team sports are about co-ordinating with your team mates.  In a sport such as basketball, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court.  It is this confidence that seems to be boosted by the familiarity of playing at home, regardless of any differences in the playing conditions.\r\nThere is a further possibility, one that connects to the darker side of sport.  Researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were average before training sessions and away matches, but were up to 67 per cent higher before home matches.  This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers such as in the recent Rugby World Cup.  There were two classic games in which the underdogs, playing at home, triumphed against better-fancied opposition, using grit, channelled aggression and a seemingly unquenchable refusal to be intimidated – this had all the hallmarks of home advantage.

    "Question": "Everyone knows that sports teams enjoy a big advantage whenever they play at home.  But does anyone know why?  Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious.

    "Question": "The founder of a multinational corporation recently announced that his company would no longer be keeping track of its employees’ paid holiday time. The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy. According to the founder of the multinational corporation, the idea came to him via a cheery email (reproduced in many newspapers) from his daughter. In it she sounds suspiciously like a copywriter from her father’s media team. Setting aside the fact that the means by which the announcement was made seems like a hollow attempt at ‘humanising’ what may turn out to be a less than generous policy decision, let us ask: is the idea practical?\r\nThe internet company and the multinational corporation are fundamentally distinct – the former has 2,000 employees and provides a single service, while the latter has 50,000 employees with dozens of subsidiary companies providing services as diverse as financial services, transport, and healthcare. The approach of ‘take as much time off as you want as long as you’re sure it won’t damage the business’ seems better suited to a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules, and so may be more comfortable in assessing whether their absence would harm the business – in any case a problematically abstract notion.\r\nThe founder of the multinational has stated that his employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they ‘feel a hundred percent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business –  or, for that matter, their careers.’ Is it possible to be that sure? No matter how many loose ends you manage to tie up in advance of a holiday, there is always a mountain of work to come back to. That is simply the nature of leave; you put your work on hold, but its accumulation is inevitable and beyond your control. Someone who follows these guidelines would likely not go at all, or, at the very least, would feel overly guilty about going. Increased levels of guilt lead to stress and this, together with workers not taking sufficient leave, would lead to a decrease in productivity in the long run.\r\nThe situation could be compounded by pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Such pressure already affects decisions such as when to start and end the working day. Particularly in the corporate sector, there is a culture of working late, and it is easy to see how this could translate into a ‘no holiday’ culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotion. Similarly, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Essentially, they would no longer have their legal entitlement to fall back on. Perhaps then, the policy would result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave, or, they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete.\r\nModern technology, which allows us to receive work messages whenever and wherever we are, has blurred the distinction between work and leisure time. The internet company apparently began their unlimited leave policy when their employees asked how this new way of working could be reconciled with the company’s old-fashioned time-off policy. That is to say, if their employer was no longer able to accurately track employees’ total time on the job, why should it apply a different and outmoded standard to their time away from it? However, a potentially problematic corollary of having no set working hours is that all hours are feasibly working hours. Employees can never be sure whether or not their working hours are being monitored by their employer, causing them to internalise this scrutiny and become self-disciplining, with possibly destructive effects. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity and productivity which are cited as the desired results of the unlimited leave policy can all exist independently of worker well-being.

    "Question": "The founder of a multinational corporation recently announced that his company would no longer be keeping track of its employees’ paid holiday time. The move was apparently inspired by an internet company which has instigated a similar policy.

    "Question": "I bought my first metal detector soon after I was married - £70 was a lot of money then, and would probably have been better spent on something sensible for the house. Still, my wife, Marion, couldn't help but be impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've uncovered has given me pleasure - that sense of being connected to the past is one I've always found satisfying. But after the gold ring, 40 years passed before I made another discovery that impressed Marion as much. \r\nIt was a dull February afternoon and I had a couple of hours to spare and a location in mind. But it was raining, so I decided to to settle for a closer spot I knew to contain mainly old farming machinery. The first time my detector bleeped, I uncovered a fragment of a metal wheel. Then, as the detector swung on my arm it bleeped again. I tried to ignore it, but couldn't walk away without knowing for sure. \r\nI'd dug down half a metre and was on my stomach in the mud when a rounded, golden ball became visible. Having dug up brass curtain rails in the past, I tried to keep my expectations in check. But as I brushed more dirt away, the ball resolved itself into a fat, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared. Eventually, I remembered to breathe. I'd seen something like this before - the Great Torc, on display in the British Museum. It’s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain - a period over 2,000 years ago. Torc means ‘twist’ and it's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring just like the one I was looking at. \r\nI carried it to the car. At every junction on the drive home, I stared at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. A rinse in my kitchen sink was\r\nprobably the only clean the torc had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. ‘What is it?’ she said after a few moments. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery.\r\nNeither of us tried the torc on; the risk of damaging it was too great. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We'd never been burgled, but anxiety made me restless.  Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office and hid it underneath. The law states that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days of discovery. I was determined to enjoy the torc as much as possible before I gave it up - I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in hospital. Finally, I carried it into the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone as I placed the torc on his desk, and had his back to me. He turned, still talking, then stopped in mid-sentence. \r\nThe torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's currently in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself. But the torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say to me, ‘Now you've made such a fabulous find, I suppose you're going to stop detecting.’ But those brooches and coins are no less interesting now.

It’s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain - a period over 2,000 years ago. Torc means ‘twist’ and it's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring just like the one I was looking at. \r\nI carried it to the car. At every junction on the drive home, I stared at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. A rinse in my kitchen sink was\r\nprobably the only clean the torc had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still gazing at my find, I heard my wife come into the room, then stop in her tracks. ‘What is it?’ she said after a few moments. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery.\r\nNeither of us tried the torc on; the risk of damaging it was too great. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We'd never been burgled, but anxiety made me restless.  Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office and hid it underneath. The law states that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days of discovery. I was determined to enjoy the torc as much as possible before I gave it up - I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in hospital. Finally, I carried it into the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone as I placed the torc on his desk, and had his back to me. He turned, still talking, then stopped in mid-sentence. \r\nThe torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's currently in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself. But the torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say to me, ‘Now you've made such a fabulous find, I suppose you're going to stop detecting.’ But those brooches and coins are no less interesting now. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop - not while there's the chance of a bigger fish tomorrow. \r\nWhat is the writer suggesting by the phrase ‘remembered to breathe’ in line 28?",

    "Question": "I bought my first metal detector soon after I was married - £70 was a lot of money then, and would probably have been better spent on something sensible for the house.

    "Question": "Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him. His perfect temperature, he says, is -18C.  Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’\r\nHe is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’\r\n‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\r\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\r\n‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’\r\nNow Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.\r\nWhat do we learn about Allan in the first paragraph?",

It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’\r\n‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately he could not identify which birds they were.\r\nWhen Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses.\r\n‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm.

    "Question": "On that day, as Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line, the press gathered to make sense of her extraordinary run. It was noted that her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Intrigued journalists quizzed her on the benefits of a wonderful natural treatment, emu oil. This was a product Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended, to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training.\r\nRadcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\r\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race. And Hartmann was actually infuriated at this, although he admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was would be thinking it was a risk starting off so fast.\r\nWith 800m left to run Radcliffe began to calculate. It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking ‘I can run quicker than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.’ Regrettably that was not to be.\r\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\r\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\r\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, “I can relax back,” it was always: “keep hitting it as hard as you can.”\r\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak.

Looking back she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. Personally though, she felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.\r\nDuring the race Gary Lough, (Radcliffe's husband and coach) was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Alongside him sat Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometres Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. He was afraid it could make her drop out of the race.

It struck her she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she recalls thinking ‘I can run quicker than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought he'd see anyone come near that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year” I really did think I would.’ Regrettably that was not to be.\r\nAfter the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometres she was covering each week. He says ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.’\r\nHartmann describes travelling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base only to be greeted at the door with a shout from her husband, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I'd barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that period Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.\r\nCan Radcliffe herself explain why no-one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've got the race won, that probably did push me to it because there was never a time where I thought, “I can relax back,” it was always: “keep hitting it as hard as you can.”\r\nRadcliffe did not know it then but that marathon was her career peak.

    "Question": "‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The assembled group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who’d had some experience of freestyle ski-jumping, and presumably wanted to preserve his reputation as someone who knew exactly what he was doing, soon pushed forward, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Even to our untutored eyes, something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth then kindly informed us, ‘speed is an unpredictable beast.’\r\nPerhaps I just wasn’t cut out for this freestyle stuff. On previous skiing holidays, I’d enjoyed messing about, practising turns in the snow. I just wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. Deep down, I'd always thought it looked fun, but reckoned that, with my lack of know-how, if I’d tried to join with the skateboarders, with their baggy trousers and special language, I’d have risked total ridicule.\r\nThen my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, from which students leapt, shrieking attempted their new tricks, then landed in pits of foam cubes –  hardly a realistic introduction to what lay ahead of us out on the slopes. After practising their moves indoors, students headed outside to try them for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan cheerily assured us. ‘Before places like this trained people up, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’\r\nThe ‘knuckle’ Gareth was referring to is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again to become the landing zone proper.  Land in the zone and your motion continues forward, minimising impact. Land on the flat and you stop dead, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, though, it was all but impossible to convince my body to ignore what my brain was screaming at me and to race straight towards the jump. My legs would virtually go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came slamming down onto the knuckle. I managed not to fall but by midday I felt several centimetres shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. \r\nDay two started on the trampolines in the centre. I'd expected to hate being stuck indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some of the drills copied moves we’d make while ski-jumping, others were aimed at teaching ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in space. Gareth gave us a running commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ apparently needed work – and it’s true that, every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and nothing more until I found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.\r\nWe moved back to the mountain to try again. Inevitably, there were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as delighted as me, and for a few moments I was walking on air, with the sheer pride of having achieved such an elusive goal. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to reduce speed as I approached the jump, became airborne,  and came down appropriately in the landing zone.

    "Question": "‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The assembled group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who’d had some experience of freestyle ski-jumping, and presumably wanted to preserve his reputation as someone who knew exactly what he was doing, soon pushed forward, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Even to our untutored eyes, something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth then kindly informed us, ‘speed is an unpredictable beast.’\r\nPerhaps I just wasn’t cut out for this freestyle stuff. On previous skiing holidays, I’d enjoyed messing about, practising turns in the snow. I just wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. Deep down, I'd always thought it looked fun, but reckoned that, with my lack of know-how, if I’d tried to join with the skateboarders, with their baggy trousers and special language, I’d have risked total ridicule.\r\nThen my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, from which students leapt, shrieking attempted their new tricks, then landed in pits of foam cubes –  hardly a realistic introduction to what lay ahead of us out on the slopes. After practising their moves indoors, students headed outside to try them for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan cheerily assured us. ‘Before places like this trained people up, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’\r\nThe ‘knuckle’ Gareth was referring to is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again to become the landing zone proper.  Land in the zone and your motion continues forward, minimising impact. Land on the flat and you stop dead, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, though, it was all but impossible to convince my body to ignore what my brain was screaming at me and to race straight towards the jump. My legs would virtually go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came slamming down onto the knuckle. I managed not to fall but by midday I felt several centimetres shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. \r\nDay two started on the trampolines in the centre. I'd expected to hate being stuck indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some of the drills copied moves we’d make while ski-jumping, others were aimed at teaching ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in space. Gareth gave us a running commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ apparently needed work – and it’s true that, every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and nothing more until I found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.\r\nWe moved back to the mountain to try again. Inevitably, there were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as delighted as me, and for a few moments I was walking on air, with the sheer pride of having achieved such an elusive goal. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to reduce speed as I approached the jump, became airborne,  and came down appropriately in the landing zone. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet.\r\nThe indoor training centre that Harry attended",

    "Question": "At 25, Miranda Ellington has already achieved a great deal as a choreographer, creating works for a long list of theatres and dance companies. On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I’m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it’s like to be rehearsing all day long,’ she tells me. \r\n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. ‘A dancer who’s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They’re hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.’ \r\nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. ‘There may be a piece of music I’m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I’m still required to find solutions. That won’t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces – it’d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I’m always working on big productions – the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn’t negotiable.’ \r\nMiranda really doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. ‘I do feel it’s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.’\r\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s required. It’s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.’\r\nI’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I’ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that’s just disappointing.’\r\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to put a label on you and I can’t quite understand that. And there’s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too. I tend not to go along with that, though the time may come when I’m happy to have a reputation largely for doing one thing.

    "Question": "At 25, Miranda Ellington has already achieved a great deal as a choreographer, creating works for a long list of theatres and dance companies. On top of that, she still dances from time to time. I’m puzzled as to why she crams both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Being a dancer again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can lose sight of what it’s like to be rehearsing all day long,’ she tells me. \r\n As a choreographer, she is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. ‘A dancer who’s just starting out is often receptive to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They’re hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses. The incomplete picture they have of their skills ensures they take on board even quite harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, though when they do I welcome their honest feedback.’ \r\nWhen Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps, and the music dictates what she does. ‘There may be a piece of music I’m not keen on, but I still make sure I come up with the best possible dance routine to accompany it.  If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I’m still required to find solutions. That won’t involve going back to the drawing board and selecting a new piece, though. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and be given the option of switching to different pieces – it’d certainly help to lift the mood when things get tough in rehearsals. Unfortunately, these days I’m always working on big productions – the musical score has already been written by the composer and it isn’t negotiable.’ \r\nMiranda really doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. ‘I do feel it’s valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. However, I have to bear in mind all these theatres and schools  I work with have methods and styles which have very little in common with each other. So I have to be prepared to adapt the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than go in there and just do the same old thing. And that does mean that I avoid becoming too set in my ways.’\r\nThe conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous-looking documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really does attempt to give viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer is getting endless corrections and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s required. It’s painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.’\r\nI’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or other dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together.  Perfection may be too much to ask for, but at the same time aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.  I’ve even been involved in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props completely distracts. And that’s just disappointing.’\r\nMiranda has done such a range of work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to put a label on you and I can’t quite understand that. And there’s the modern tendency to encourage the development of expertise in a narrow area, too. I tend not to go along with that, though the time may come when I’m happy to have a reputation largely for doing one thing. For now, I just want to widen my horizons.’\r\nHow does Miranda think she benefits from working in different places?",
    "Answer_A": "It allows her to make useful social connections.",
    "Answer_B": "It means that she isn’t easily influenced by other people.  ",
    "Answer_C": "It prevents her from sticking to one approach in her work.",

    "Question": "At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do.  Nearly all the children know how to swim and play table-tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them.  Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end.  This makes them feel great.\r\nWe do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week.  It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds.  We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time.  First we tell them they can phone home after lunch.  Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow.  Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.\r\nIt's not always the children who feel lonely.  We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is getting on, which is quite unnecessary.
